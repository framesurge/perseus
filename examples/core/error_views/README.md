# Error Views Example

This example shows how error views work in Perseus. Although the other examples forcefully set the inbuilt development default error views for simplicity, you should always create your own error views in real-world apps, especially if you're using internationalization: this example shows you how!

Note that the index page of this example is deliberately designed to panic immediately, to showcase the panic handler.
