# Preload Example

This example demonstrates Perseus' inbuilt imperative preloading functionality, which allows downloading all the assets needed to render a page ahead-of-time, so that, when the user reaches that page, they can go to it without any network requests being needed!

This uses i18n to demonstrate that preloading handles multiple locales with ease.
