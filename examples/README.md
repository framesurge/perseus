# Examples

This folder contains examples for Perseus, which are used to test the project and are excellent learning resources! If any of these don't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/choose) to let us know!

These examples are all fully self-contained, and do not serve as examples in the traditional Cargo way, they are each indepedent crates to enable the use of build tools such as `wasm-pack`.

-   Showcase -- an app that demonstrates all the different features of Perseus, including SSR, SSG, and ISR (this example is actively used for testing/development)
-   Basic -- a simple app that uses the Perseus CLI
    -   This has `.perseus/` included in Git, it's where that's developed
-   i18n -- a simple app that showcases internationalization in particular
-   Tiny -- the smallest Perseus can get, the _Hello World!_ example
