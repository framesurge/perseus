# Full Page Layout Example

Perseus currently has some UI quirks, which can make building full-page layouts (i.e. those with headers and footers) a little difficult. This example uses a simple stylesheet to make an app with a sticky header and footer, that can support content of any height, using CSS Grid for flexibility and convenience.

*Note: the UI quirks that make this a little tricky will be resolved by the time v0.4.0 becomes stable.*

**Warning:** there is currently a strange page transition bug when going between the index and long pages...
