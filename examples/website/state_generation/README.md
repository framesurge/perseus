# Tiny Example

This example shows the smallest possible and meaningful Perseus app, a simple 'Hello World!' app. This is considered a comprehensive example because it doesn't show a particular feature of Perseus, nor does it demonstrate how to do a common task. The structure of this example isn't likely to be used anywhere in the real world (your templates and error pages would nearly always be in separate files), but it shows the absolute basics of Perseus and helps new users to hit the ground running.
