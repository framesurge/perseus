        "en-US": "Seed was one of the first Rust web frameworks to support server-side rendering, and, while it has the performance advantages of Wasm, it lacks a fully developed fullstack state platform: Perseus supports the generation of state at build-time or request-time (or both), and that state can be reactively passed around an app, while Seed uses a more traditional MVC approach, and supports only request-time generation."
