        "en-US": "GatsbyJS is a fullstack framework that brought static site generation (build-time state generation, in Perseus) to the mainstream. However, Perseus remains faster than Gatsby at runtime, and is easier to configure for certain common use-cases, sch as internationalization. GatsbyJS has more recently embraced server-side rendering, though the integration between that and build-time state generation is present only in Perseus."
