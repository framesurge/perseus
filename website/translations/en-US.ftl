index-opts =
    .heading = You want options? We got options.
    .desc = Perseus comes with a built-in plugins system and full customizability of almost every part of the system. Static exporting? Serverful deployment? Fetch data by carrier pigeon? Easy.

comparisons-table-details =
    .language = The programming language this framework is built in. (Hint: Rust is the fastest!)
    .supports_ssg = Whether or not the framework supports pre-rendering pages at build-time.
    .supports_ssr = Whether or not the framework supports rendering pages dynamically when they're requested.
    .supports_ssr_ssg_same_page = Whether or not the framework supports SSG and SSR (see above) in the very same page.
    .supports_i18n = Whether or not the framework supports building a multilingual app. Some frameworks support this through plugins.
    .supports_incremental = Whether or not the framework supports rendering pages on-demand and then caching them for future use.
    .supports_revalidation = Whether or not the framework supports rebuilding pages that were built at build-time at request-time. Some frameworks can do this by time, or by custom logic. Perseus supports both.
    .inbuilt_cli = Whether or not the framework has a command-line interface for convenient usage. Some frameworks use third-party CLIs.
    .inbuilt_routing = Whether or not the framework supports inbuilt routing. Most frameworks have their own way of doing this if they do support it.
    .supports_shell = Whether or not this framework has an app shell, which makes switching pages much faster and cleaner.
    .supports_deployment = Whether or not this framework supports easy deployment. Perseus can deploy in one command.
    .supports_exporting = Whether or not this framework can operate without a server, as a series of purely static files.
    .homepage_lighthouse_desktop = The Lighthouse score out of 100 for desktop (higher is better). These are collected from Google's PageSpeed Insights tool. These are for the framework's website, and may not reflect the performance of all sites made with the framework.
    .homepage_lighthouse_mobile = The Lighthouse score out of 100 for mobile (higher is better). These are collected from Google's PageSpeed Insights tool. These are for the framework's website, and may not reflect the performance of all sites made with the framework.
comparisons-sycamore-heading = Perseus vs Sycamore
comparisons-sycamore-text = Perseus is a framework that uses Sycamore to write views (the things users see), so there's not much point in comparing the two as competitors. However, Sycamore can be used without Perseus, which works perfectly well, though you'll miss out on features like inbuilt internationalization, static generation (though you could build this yourself), and incremental generation. If you want to build just a bit of your site with Rust, Sycamore is the perfect tool, Perseus is a full framework designed for building entire websites.
