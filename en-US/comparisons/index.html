However, Sycamore can be used without Perseus, which works perfectly well, though you'll miss out on features like inbuilt internationalization, static generation (though you could build this yourself), and incremental generation. If you want to build just a bit of your site with Rust, Sycamore is the perfect tool, Perseus is a full framework designed for building entire websites.</p></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="w-full flex justify-center py-5 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-navy-deep" data-hk="16.12"><p data-hk="16.13" class="dark:text-white mx-5 text-center"><span data-hk="16.14">© <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7" class="underline">arctic-hen7</a> ⁨2021⁩, see license <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/LICENSE" class="underline">here</a>.</span></p></footer></div></div></div></body></html>
