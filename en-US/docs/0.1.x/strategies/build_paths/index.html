window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"Build Paths","content":"<h1>Build Paths</h1>\\n<p>This strategy allows you to define the pages a template will render. For example, you might use this for a blog posts system to get all the posts from a database and return a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> of them. This strategy is roughly equivalent to NextJS's <code>get_static_paths</code> function.</p>\\n<p>Every element returned here will have the opportunity to create its state with the <em>build state</em> strategy, being passed the path defined here. Note that every element returned here will be built, so if you need to return more than about 10 elements, it's a better idea to only return the most used ones and leave the rest to the <em>incremental generation</em> strategy to reduce your build time.</p>\\n<h2>Usage</h2>\\n<p>You can define a function for this strategy like so:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">pub async fn get_build_paths() -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;, String&gt; {\\n    Ok(vec![\\n        &quot;test&quot;.to_string(),\\n        &quot;blah/test/blah&quot;.to_string()\\n    ])\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Paths returned from this function will be rendered under <code>[template-path]/[returned-path]</code>, and they should not have a leading or trailing <code>/</code>. If you want to return a nested path, simply do so (but make sure to handle it properly in your router). Note that any errors must be returned as <code>String</code>s, and the function must be asynchronous.</p>\\n<p>You can add this strategy to a template like so:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">template\\n\\t// ...\\n\\t.build_paths_fn(Box::new(get_static_paths))\\n</code></pre>\\n","sidebar_content":"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/intro\\">Introduction</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/setup\\">Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/arch\\">Architecture</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/intro\\">Building Your First App</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/setup\\">Installation and Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/template\\">Writing Your First Template</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/app\\">Setting up the App Itself</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/cli\\">CLI</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/templates\\">Templates</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/routing\\">Routing</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/error_pages\\">Error Pages</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/intro\\">Rendering Strategies</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_paths\\">Build Paths</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_state\\">Build State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/request_state\\">Request State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/revalidation\\">Revalidation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/incremental\\">Incremental generation</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/building\\">Building</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/serving\\">Serving</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/integrations/actix-web\\">Actix Web Integration</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/config_managers\\">Config Managers</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n","status":"Outdated","manifest":{"0.2.x":{"state":"outdated","git":"v0.2.3","docs_rs":"0.2"},"0.1.x":{"state":"outdated","git":"v0.1.4","docs_rs":"0.1"},"0.3.0-0.3.3":{"state":"outdated","git":"v0.3.3","docs_rs":"0.3.3"},"0.4.x":{"state":"beta","git":"HEAD","docs_rs":"0.4.0-beta"},"0.3.4":{"state":"stable","git":"eccf137032fbe8e6507be9e9317edc16e7576a4f","docs_rs":"0.3"}},"current_version":"0.1.x"}`;</script>

<p>This strategy allows you to define the pages a template will render. For example, you might use this for a blog posts system to get all the posts from a database and return a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> of them. This strategy is roughly equivalent to NextJS's <code>get_static_paths</code> function.</p>
<p>Every element returned here will have the opportunity to create its state with the <em>build state</em> strategy, being passed the path defined here. Note that every element returned here will be built, so if you need to return more than about 10 elements, it's a better idea to only return the most used ones and leave the rest to the <em>incremental generation</em> strategy to reduce your build time.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You can define a function for this strategy like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub async fn get_build_paths() -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;, String&gt; {
    Ok(vec![
        &quot;test&quot;.to_string(),
        &quot;blah/test/blah&quot;.to_string()
    ])
}
</code></pre>
<p>Paths returned from this function will be rendered under <code>[template-path]/[returned-path]</code>, and they should not have a leading or trailing <code>/</code>. If you want to return a nested path, simply do so (but make sure to handle it properly in your router). Note that any errors must be returned as <code>String</code>s, and the function must be asynchronous.</p>
<p>You can add this strategy to a template like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">template
	// ...
	.build_paths_fn(Box::new(get_static_paths))
</code></pre>
