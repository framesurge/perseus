This is the page itself, and it contains its actual markup, in Sycamore's templating syntax (you can read more about that <a href=\\"\\">here</a>). Next is the <em>template function</em>, which simply defines a function that will actually render the page. We break this simple closure out into a function to get it because we'll reuse it in the routing process later. If your page takes a state, it will be passed to this closure <strong>as a string</strong>. You must then deserialize it, and it is safe to <code>.unwrap()</code> here (barring a horrific logic failure). The final function we define is the <em>page function</em>, which just creates the actual template for the page.</p>\\n<h2>Template Definition</h2>\\n<p>You can define a template with the <code>Template::new()</code> method, which takes the template's path as an argument (with no leading or trailing slashes). In the above example, <code>about</code> renders only one page, which would be hosted at <code>/about</code>.</p>\\n<p>The only mandatory builder function after that is <code>.template()</code>, which defines your template function (the closure inside <code>template_fn()</code> in the above example). There are a number of other functions available to customize how the template renders, all of which are documented <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/intro\\">here</a>.</p>\\n","current_version":"0.1.x","manifest":{"0.1.x":{"docs_rs":"0.1","git":"v0.1.4","state":"outdated"},"0.2.x":{"docs_rs":"0.2","git":"v0.2.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.0-0.3.3":{"docs_rs":"0.3.3","git":"v0.3.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.4":{"docs_rs":"0.3","git":"v0.3.6","state":"stable"},"0.4.x":{"docs_rs":"0.4.0-beta","git":"HEAD","state":"beta"}},"sidebar_content":"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/intro\\">Introduction</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/setup\\">Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/arch\\">Architecture</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/intro\\">Building Your First App</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/setup\\">Installation and Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/template\\">Writing Your First Template</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/app\\">Setting up the App Itself</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/cli\\">CLI</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/templates\\">Templates</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/routing\\">Routing</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/error_pages\\">Error Pages</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/intro\\">Rendering Strategies</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_paths\\">Build Paths</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_state\\">Build State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/request_state\\">Request State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/revalidation\\">Revalidation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/incremental\\">Incremental generation</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/building\\">Building</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/serving\\">Serving</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/integrations/actix-web\\">Actix Web Integration</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/config_managers\\">Config Managers</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n","status":"Outdated","title":"Templates"}`;

<p>The most central part of Perseus is the definition of templates, which control how pages are built.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>An extremely simple template would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::Template;
use sycamore::prelude::{component, template, GenericNode, Template as SycamoreTemplate};

#[component(AboutPage&lt;G&gt;)]
pub fn about_page() -&gt; SycamoreTemplate&lt;G&gt; {
    template! {
        p { &quot;About.&quot; }
    }
}

pub fn template_fn&lt;G: GenericNode&gt;() -&gt; perseus::template::TemplateFn&lt;G&gt; {
    Box::new(|_| {
        template! {
            AboutPage()
        }
    })
}

pub fn get_template&lt;G: GenericNode&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {
    Template::new(&quot;about&quot;).template(template_fn())
}
</code></pre>
<p>First, we define the <em>component function</em>, which is done with Sycamore. This is the page itself, and it contains its actual markup, in Sycamore's templating syntax (you can read more about that <a href="">here</a>). Next is the <em>template function</em>, which simply defines a function that will actually render the page. We break this simple closure out into a function to get it because we'll reuse it in the routing process later. If your page takes a state, it will be passed to this closure <strong>as a string</strong>. You must then deserialize it, and it is safe to <code>.unwrap()</code> here (barring a horrific logic failure). The final function we define is the <em>page function</em>, which just creates the actual template for the page.</p>
<h2>Template Definition</h2>
<p>You can define a template with the <code>Template::new()</code> method, which takes the template's path as an argument (with no leading or trailing slashes). In the above example, <code>about</code> renders only one page, which would be hosted at <code>/about</code>.</p>
<p>The only mandatory builder function after that is <code>.template()</code>, which defines your template function (the closure inside <code>template_fn()</code> in the above example). There are a number of other functions available to customize how the template renders, all of which are documented <a href="https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/intro">here</a>.</p>
