window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"content":"<h1>Migrating from v0.3.x</h1>\\n<p>Perseus v0.4.x added a significant number of breaking changes, as almost the entire Perseus core was rewritten from scratch, along with a full migration to Sycamore v0.8.x, which requires some rewriting of your view code, most of which is covered on the <a href=\\"https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app\\">Sycamore website</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Perseus v0.4.x is now in its final beta period, meaning new features are probably not going to be added until v0.4.0 goes stable. However, due to the full rewrite, we want to make sure there are no outstanding bugs before pushing the full stable release. Please report even the smallest bugs you encounter to us on GitHub, and we can make Perseus v0.4.0 the best it can be.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Restructure your <code>Cargo.toml</code> to reflect the new dependency-splitting format (which splits engine-side dependencies from those only needed in the browser). See <a href=\\"https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/tree/main/examples/core/basic/Cargo.toml\\">here</a> for an example. Note that this will involve adding a server integration for use, like <code>perseus-warp</code>.</li>\\n<li>Upgrade the Perseus CLI with <code>cargo install perseus-cli --version 0.4.0-beta.16</code>.</li>\\n<li>Delete the old <code>.perseus/</code> directory (this is no longer needed).</li>\\n<li>Rename your <code>lib.rs</code> file to <code>main.rs</code>.</li>\\n<li>Update each error page instantiation function to provide, as another argument, a function that returns a Sycamore <code>View&lt;G&gt;</code> for the document metadata of that error page (e.g. title).</li>\\n<li>Change the <code>#[perseus::main]</code> attribute on the function in <code>main.rs</code> to be <code>#[perseus::main(perseus_warp::dflt_server)]</code> (replace <code>perseus_warp</code> with whatever server integration you decide to use).</li>\\n<li>Update your view code for Sycamore's new version (mostly including adding a <code>cx</code> parameter as the first argument of every function that returns a <code>View&lt;G&gt;</code>).</li>\\n<li>Add <code>.build()</code> to the bottom of all <code>Template::new</code> calls, and change those to <code>Template::build</code>.</li>\\n<li>Remove <code>#[perseus::template_rx]</code> and <code>#[perseus::template]</code> entirely. Templates that take state should use <code>#[auto_scope]</code> now.</li>\\n<li>Remove lifetimes from templates that take state, as these can be handled by <code>#[auto_scope]</code> now. See the <code>#[auto_scope]</code> docs for more details, including on how to do this manually.</li>\\n<li>Change all <code>.template()</code> calls (on <code>Template</code>, not <code>PerseusApp</code>) to be <code>.view()</code> (for templates that take no state), <code>.view_with_unreactive_state()</code> for unreactive state, or <code>.view_with_state()</code> for reactive state.</li>\\n<li>Change <code>#[make_rx]</code> to <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, ReactiveState)]</code>. You'll need to derive <code>UnreactiveState</code> on unreactive state types as well.</li>\\n<li>Replace all macros like <code>#[build_state]</code> with <code>#[engine_only_fn]</code> (these have all been combined and simplified).</li>\\n<li>Replace <code>RenderFnResult</code>/<code>RenderFnResultWithCause</code> with your own error types. For blamed types (i.e. everything other than build paths), your error should be wrapped in <code>BlamedError</code>. If you don't actually need to return an error, you can return your state directly now, without any <code>Result</code>!</li>\\n<li>Replace uses of <code>blame_err!</code> with manually returning a <code>BlamedError</code>. This API has been dramatically simplified.</li>\\n<li>Make your header setting functions take a scope <code>cx</code> as their first argument.</li>\\n<li>Replace your <code>ErrorPages</code> with <code>ErrorViews</code> (see the documentation of this <code>struct</code>, and the <code>core/error_views</code> example for further details).</li>\\n<li>Update any manual destructuring of your state to use references (e.g. <code>let content = state.content;</code> -&gt; <code>let content = &amp;state.content;</code>).</li>\\n<li>Change <code>MyStateRx&lt;'b&gt;</code> to <code>&amp;MyStateRx</code> (you'll need <code>&amp;'b MyStateRx</code> if you're not using <code>#[auto_scope]</code>).</li>\\n<li>Update your code for any smaller breaking changes that might affect you, as per the <a href=\\"https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\\">changelog</a>.</li>\\n<li>Run <code>cargo update</code> and then <code>perseus build</code> to get everything up to date and ensure that your app works! (This might take a while the first time.)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>We realize that this is a mammoth number of breaking changes, and there will be several more if you're a plugin developer. However, Perseus v0.4.0 brings extraordinary levels of performance and ergonomics to Perseus, removing old quirks and streamlining the internals massively. With the introduction of the new capsules system, Perseus is by far the most powerful frontend framework in the world. If you're having any trouble with updating, please do not hesitate to let us know on <a href=\\"https://discord.com/invite/GNqWYWNTdp\\">Discord</a>, and we'll happily help you out as soon as we can!</p>\\n<h2>If You've Ejected</h2>\\n<p>If you were running Perseus v0.3.x and had ejected, your app's structure is likely to change significantly, as Perseus v0.4.x no longer uses <code>.perseus/</code>! For example, you can now directly modify the server Perseus runs, allowing you to add your own API routes trivially! (See the <a href=\\"https://github.com/framesurge/tree/main/examples/core/custom_server\\">custom server example</a> for details.)</p>\\n<p>The migration process you follow will be highly unique to your app's structure, though most common use-cases should be covered y the custom server example, linked above.

<p>Perseus v0.4.x added a significant number of breaking changes, as almost the entire Perseus core was rewritten from scratch, along with a full migration to Sycamore v0.8.x, which requires some rewriting of your view code, most of which is covered on the <a href="https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app">Sycamore website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Perseus v0.4.x is now in its final beta period, meaning new features are probably not going to be added until v0.4.0 goes stable. However, due to the full rewrite, we want to make sure there are no outstanding bugs before pushing the full stable release. Please report even the smallest bugs you encounter to us on GitHub, and we can make Perseus v0.4.0 the best it can be.</p>
<ol>
<li>Restructure your <code>Cargo.toml</code> to reflect the new dependency-splitting format (which splits engine-side dependencies from those only needed in the browser). See <a href="https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/tree/main/examples/core/basic/Cargo.toml">here</a> for an example. Note that this will involve adding a server integration for use, like <code>perseus-warp</code>.</li>
<li>Upgrade the Perseus CLI with <code>cargo install perseus-cli --version 0.4.0-beta.16</code>.</li>
<li>Delete the old <code>.perseus/</code> directory (this is no longer needed).</li>
<li>Rename your <code>lib.rs</code> file to <code>main.rs</code>.</li>
<li>Update each error page instantiation function to provide, as another argument, a function that returns a Sycamore <code>View&lt;G&gt;</code> for the document metadata of that error page (e.g. title).</li>
<li>Change the <code>#[perseus::main]</code> attribute on the function in <code>main.rs</code> to be <code>#[perseus::main(perseus_warp::dflt_server)]</code> (replace <code>perseus_warp</code> with whatever server integration you decide to use).</li>
<li>Update your view code for Sycamore's new version (mostly including adding a <code>cx</code> parameter as the first argument of every function that returns a <code>View&lt;G&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>Add <code>.build()</code> to the bottom of all <code>Template::new</code> calls, and change those to <code>Template::build</code>.</li>
<li>Remove <code>#[perseus::template_rx]</code> and <code>#[perseus::template]</code> entirely. Templates that take state should use <code>#[auto_scope]</code> now.</li>
<li>Remove lifetimes from templates that take state, as these can be handled by <code>#[auto_scope]</code> now. See the <code>#[auto_scope]</code> docs for more details, including on how to do this manually.</li>
<li>Change all <code>.template()</code> calls (on <code>Template</code>, not <code>PerseusApp</code>) to be <code>.view()</code> (for templates that take no state), <code>.view_with_unreactive_state()</code> for unreactive state, or <code>.view_with_state()</code> for reactive state.</li>
<li>Change <code>#[make_rx]</code> to <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, ReactiveState)]</code>. You'll need to derive <code>UnreactiveState</code> on unreactive state types as well.</li>
<li>Replace all macros like <code>#[build_state]</code> with <code>#[engine_only_fn]</code> (these have all been combined and simplified).</li>
<li>Replace <code>RenderFnResult</code>/<code>RenderFnResultWithCause</code> with your own error types. For blamed types (i.e. everything other than build paths), your error should be wrapped in <code>BlamedError</code>. If you don't actually need to return an error, you can return your state directly now, without any <code>Result</code>!</li>
<li>Replace uses of <code>blame_err!</code> with manually returning a <code>BlamedError</code>. This API has been dramatically simplified.</li>
<li>Make your header setting functions take a scope <code>cx</code> as their first argument.</li>
<li>Replace your <code>ErrorPages</code> with <code>ErrorViews</code> (see the documentation of this <code>struct</code>, and the <code>core/error_views</code> example for further details).</li>
<li>Update any manual destructuring of your state to use references (e.g. <code>let content = state.content;</code> -&gt; <code>let content = &amp;state.content;</code>).</li>
<li>Change <code>MyStateRx&lt;'b&gt;</code> to <code>&amp;MyStateRx</code> (you'll need <code>&amp;'b MyStateRx</code> if you're not using <code>#[auto_scope]</code>).</li>
<li>Update your code for any smaller breaking changes that might affect you, as per the <a href="https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</li>
<li>Run <code>cargo update</code> and then <code>perseus build</code> to get everything up to date and ensure that your app works! (This might take a while the first time.)</li>
</ol>
<p>We realize that this is a mammoth number of breaking changes, and there will be several more if you're a plugin developer. However, Perseus v0.4.0 brings extraordinary levels of performance and ergonomics to Perseus, removing old quirks and streamlining the internals massively. With the introduction of the new capsules system, Perseus is by far the most powerful frontend framework in the world. If you're having any trouble with updating, please do not hesitate to let us know on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GNqWYWNTdp">Discord</a>, and we'll happily help you out as soon as we can!</p>
<h2>If You've Ejected</h2>
<p>If you were running Perseus v0.3.x and had ejected, your app's structure is likely to change significantly, as Perseus v0.4.x no longer uses <code>.perseus/</code>! For example, you can now directly modify the server Perseus runs, allowing you to add your own API routes trivially! (See the <a href="https://github.com/framesurge/tree/main/examples/core/custom_server">custom server example</a> for details.)</p>
<p>The migration process you follow will be highly unique to your app's structure, though most common use-cases should be covered y the custom server example, linked above.
