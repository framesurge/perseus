window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"content":"<h1>Request-time state</h1>\\n<p>Request-time state can be thought of as the next level up from <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/state/build\\">build-time state</a>, because it provides access to everything build state does, plus the actual HTTP request of the user who made the query. This allows you to generate user-specific state: for instance a custom dashboard could be prerendered for them based on their settings.</p>\\n<p>Here's an example of request state being used to show a user their own IP address (as their browser reports it, which can be spoofed):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::prelude::*;\\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\\nuse sycamore::prelude::*;\\n\\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, ReactiveState)]\\n#[rx(alias = &quot;PageStateRx&quot;)]\\nstruct PageState {\\n    ip: String,\\n}\\n\\nfn request_state_page&lt;'a, G: Html&gt;(cx: BoundedScope&lt;'_, 'a&gt;, state: &amp;'a PageStateRx) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {\\n    view! { cx,\\n        p {\\n            (\\n                format!(&quot;Your IP address is {}.&quot;, state.ip.get())\\n            )\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::build(&quot;request_state&quot;)\\n        .request_state_fn(get_request_state)\\n        .view_with_state(request_state_page)\\n        .build()\\n}\\n\\n// This returns a \`Result&lt;T, BlamedError&lt;E&gt;&gt;\` (or just \`T\`) because, obviously,\\n// it will be run at request-time: any errors could be a mising file (our\\n// fault), or a malformed cookie (the client's fault), etc., so we have to note\\n// the blame to get an accurate HTTP status code. This example is really\\n// infallible, but we've spelled it all out rather than using \`T\` so you can see\\n// how it works.\\n#[engine_only_fn]\\nasync fn get_request_state(\\n    // We get all the same info as build state in here\\n    _info: StateGeneratorInfo&lt;()&gt;,\\n    // Unlike in build state, in request state we *also* get access to the information that the\\n    // user sent with their HTTP request IN this example, we extract the browser's reporting of\\n    // their IP address and display it to them\\n    req: Request,\\n) -&gt; Result&lt;PageState, BlamedError&lt;std::convert::Infallible&gt;&gt; {\\n    Ok(PageState {\\n        ip: format!(\\n            &quot;{:?}&quot;,\\n            req.headers()\\n                // NOTE: This header can be trivially spoofed, and may well not be the user's actual\\n                // IP address\\n                .get(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;)\\n                .unwrap_or(&amp;perseus::http::HeaderValue::from_str(&quot;hidden from view!&quot;).unwrap())\\n        ),\\n    })\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Just as with a <code>get_build_state</code> function, this <code>get_request_state</code> function is <code>async</code> and returns a <code>BlamedError&lt;E&gt;</code>, where <code>E</code> is any compliant error type, but it could return the <code>PageState</code> directly if it wanted to. If you need a refresher on these properties, especially on error handling in these kinds of functions, see <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/state/build\\">this page</a>.</p>\\n<p>Importantly, request-time state gives us access to the usual <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/perseus/0.4/perseus/prelude/struct.StateGeneratorInfo.html\\"><code>StateGeneratorInfo</code></a>, which contains the path, locale, and <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/state/helper\\">helper state</a>, plus the <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/prelude/type.Request@perseus\\"><code>Request</code></a>, which is an HTTP request with the body stripped out. This is done because the body is meaningless in Perseus requests, and anything that needs it should use <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/fundamentals\\">custom API endpoints</a>.</p>\\n<p>In this example, we're using <code>req</code> to access the headers of the request, which are the main things you'll use (since these contain cookies, etc.). Here, we're just accessing the non-standard <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, which represents the IP address of the client in many cases.</p>\\n<p>Critically, the request provided to this function is <strong>not</strong> the 'real' request, meaning altering parts of it will have absolutely no effect whatsoever --- it's just a representation of it provided to your functions so they can access user details. For example, if you wanted to set headers, you should not add them here, but <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/fundamentals/head-headers\\">do this</a> instead.</p>\\n<p>A request-time state generating function can be specified using <code>.request_state_fn()</code> on <code>Template</code>.</p>\\n","current_version":"0.4.x","manifest":{"0.1.x":{"docs_rs":"0.1","git":"v0.1.4","state":"outdated"},"0.2.x":{"docs_rs":"0.2","git":"v0.2.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.0-0.3.3":{"docs_rs":"0.3.3","git":"v0.3.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.4":{"docs_rs":"0.3","git":"v0.3.6","state":"outdated"},"0.4.x":{"docs_rs":"0.4","git":"HEAD","state":"stable"}},"sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

provides access to everything build state does, plus the actual HTTP request of the user who made the query. This allows you to generate user-specific state: for instance a custom dashboard could be prerendered for them based on their settings.<p>Here's an example of request state being used to show a user their own IP address (as their browser reports it, which can be spoofed):<pre><code class=language-rust>use perseus::prelude::*;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use sycamore::prelude::*;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, ReactiveState)]
#[rx(alias = "PageStateRx")]
struct PageState {
    ip: String,
}

fn request_state_page<'a, G: Html>(cx: BoundedScope<'_, 'a>, state: &'a PageStateRx) -> View&LTG> {
    view! { cx,
        p {
            (
                format!("Your IP address is {}.", state.ip.get())
            )
        }
    }
}

pub fn get_template&LTG: Html>() -> Template&LTG> {
    Template::build("request_state")
        .request_state_fn(get_request_state)
        .view_with_state(request_state_page)
        .build()
}

// This returns a `Result&LTT, BlamedError&LTE>>` (or just `T`) because, obviously,
// it will be run at request-time: any errors could be a mising file (our
// fault), or a malformed cookie (the client's fault), etc., so we have to note
// the blame to get an accurate HTTP status code. This example is really
// infallible, but we've spelled it all out rather than using `T` so you can see
// how it works.
#[engine_only_fn]
async fn get_request_state(
    // We get all the same info as build state in here
    _info: StateGeneratorInfo<()>,
    // Unlike in build state, in request state we *also* get access to the information that the
    // user sent with their HTTP request IN this example, we extract the browser's reporting of
    // their IP address and display it to them
    req: Request,
) -> Result&LTPageState, BlamedError&LTstd::convert::Infallible>> {
    Ok(PageState {
        ip: format!(
            "{:?}",
            req.headers()
                // NOTE: This header can be trivially spoofed, and may well not be the user's actual
                // IP address
                .get("X-Forwarded-For")
                .unwrap_or(&perseus::http::HeaderValue::from_str("hidden from view!").unwrap())
        ),
    })
}

</code></pre><p>Just as with a <code>get_build_state</code> function, this <code>get_request_state</code> function is <code>async</code> and returns a <code>BlamedError&LTE></code>, where <code>E</code> is any compliant error type, but it could return the <code>PageState</code> directly if it wanted to. If you need a refresher on these properties, especially on error handling in these kinds of functions, see <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/state/build>this page</a>.<p>Importantly, request-time state gives us access to the usual <a href=https://docs.rs/perseus/0.4/perseus/prelude/struct.StateGeneratorInfo.html><code>StateGeneratorInfo</code></a>, which contains the path, locale, and <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/state/helper>helper state</a>, plus the <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/prelude/type.Request@perseus><code>Request</code></a>, which is an HTTP request with the body stripped out. This is done because the body is meaningless in Perseus requests, and anything that needs it should use <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/fundamentals>custom API endpoints</a>.<p>In this example, we're using <code>req</code> to access the headers of the request, which are the main things you'll use (since these contain cookies, etc.). Here, we're just accessing the non-standard <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, which represents the IP address of the client in many cases.<p>Critically, the request provided to this function is <strong>not</strong> the 'real' request, meaning altering parts of it will have absolutely no effect whatsoever --- it's just a representation of it provided to your functions so they can access user details. For example, if you wanted to set headers, you should not add them here, but <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/fundamentals/head-headers>do this</a> instead.<p>A request-time state generating function can be specified using <code>.request_state_fn()</code> on <code>Template</code>.</div></main></div><div data-hk=2.15 class=row-start-2><footer data-hk=7.0 class="w-full flex justify-center py-5 bg-black text-white"><p data-hk=7.1 class="mx-5 text-center"><span data-hk=7.2>© <a href=https://github.com/arctic-hen7 class=underline>arctic-hen7</a> 2021-2023, see license <a href=https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/blob/main/LICENSE class=underline>here</a>.</span></footer></div></div></div></main><script data-hk=0.0 src=.perseus/static/prism.js defer></script><script data-hk=0.1>window.Prism.highlightAll();</script></div><div id=__perseus_popup_error></div>
