window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"Modifying the \`<head>\`","content":"<h1>Modifying the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h1>\\n<p>A big issue with only having one <code>index.html</code> file for your whole app is that you don't have the ability to define different <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>s and HTML metadata for each page.</p>\\n<p>However, Perseus overcomes this easily by allowing you to specify <code>.head()</code> on a <code>Template&lt;G&gt;</code>, which should be a function that returns a <code>Template&lt;SsrNode&gt;</code> (but you can use write <code>perseus::HeadFn</code> as the return type, it's an alias for that). The <code>view!</code> you define here will be rendered to a <code>String</code> and directly interpolated into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of any pages this template renders. If you need it to be different based on the properties, you're covered, it takes the same properties as the normal template function! (They're deserialized automatically by the <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro.)</p>\\n<p>The only particular thing to note here is that, because this is rendered to a <code>String</code>, this <strong>can't be reactive</strong>. Variable interpolation is fine, but after it's been rendered once, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> <strong>will not change</strong>. If you need to update it later, you should do that with <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/web-sys\\"><code>web_sys</code></a>, which lets you directly access any DOM element with similar syntax to JavaScript (in fact, it's your one-stop shop for all things interfacing with the browser, as well as it's companion <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/js-sys\\"><code>js-sys</code></a>).</p>\\n<p>Here's an example of modifying a page's metadata (taken from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/basic/src/templates/index.rs\\">here</a>):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">    }\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]\\npub async fn get_build_state(\\n    _path: String,\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Script Loading</h2>\\n<p>One unfortunate caveat with Perseus' current approach to modifying the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is that any new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s you add will fail to load. This is because browsers only run new new scripts if they're appended as individual nodes, and Perseus sets the entire new <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in bulk. for this reason, you should put <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s at the top of the rest of your template instead. That way, they'll still load before your code, but they'll also actually load!</p>\\n<p>If you really need to put a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for some reason, you could append it directly using <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/web-sys\\"><code>web_sys</code></a>, though you should make sure that it doesn't work with the rest of your code first.</p>\\n<p>Note that any scripts in your <code>index.html</code> are constant across all pages, and will load correctly.</p>\\n","sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>A big issue with only having one <code>index.html</code> file for your whole app is that you don't have the ability to define different <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>s and HTML metadata for each page.</p>
<p>However, Perseus overcomes this easily by allowing you to specify <code>.head()</code> on a <code>Template&lt;G&gt;</code>, which should be a function that returns a <code>Template&lt;SsrNode&gt;</code> (but you can use write <code>perseus::HeadFn</code> as the return type, it's an alias for that). The <code>view!</code> you define here will be rendered to a <code>String</code> and directly interpolated into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of any pages this template renders. If you need it to be different based on the properties, you're covered, it takes the same properties as the normal template function! (They're deserialized automatically by the <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro.)</p>
<p>The only particular thing to note here is that, because this is rendered to a <code>String</code>, this <strong>can't be reactive</strong>. Variable interpolation is fine, but after it's been rendered once, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> <strong>will not change</strong>. If you need to update it later, you should do that with <a href="https://docs.rs/web-sys"><code>web_sys</code></a>, which lets you directly access any DOM element with similar syntax to JavaScript (in fact, it's your one-stop shop for all things interfacing with the browser, as well as it's companion <a href="https://docs.rs/js-sys"><code>js-sys</code></a>).</p>
<p>Here's an example of modifying a page's metadata (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/basic/src/templates/index.rs">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    }
}

#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]
pub async fn get_build_state(
    _path: String,
</code></pre>
<h2>Script Loading</h2>
<p>One unfortunate caveat with Perseus' current approach to modifying the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is that any new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s you add will fail to load. This is because browsers only run new new scripts if they're appended as individual nodes, and Perseus sets the entire new <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in bulk. for this reason, you should put <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s at the top of the rest of your template instead. That way, they'll still load before your code, but they'll also actually load!</p>
<p>If you really need to put a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for some reason, you could append it directly using <a href="https://docs.rs/web-sys"><code>web_sys</code></a>, though you should make sure that it doesn't work with the rest of your code first.</p>
<p>Note that any scripts in your <code>index.html</code> are constant across all pages, and will load correctly.</p>
