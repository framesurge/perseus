The only thing you'll need in a plugin is the <code>perseus</code> crate, though you'll probably want to bring other libraries in (like <code>sycamore</code> if you're adding templates or error pages).</p>\\n<h2>Defining a Plugin</h2>\\n<p>To define a plugin, you'll call <code>perseus::plugins::Plugin::new()</code>, which takes four parameters:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The name of the plugin as a <code>&amp;str</code>, which should be the name of the crate the plugin is in (or the name of a larger app with some extension) (<strong>all plugins MUST have unique names</strong>)</li>\\n<li>A <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/functional\\">functional actions</a> registrar function, which is given some functional actions and then extends them</li>\\n<li>A <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/control\\">control actions</a> registrar, which is given some control actions and then extends them</li>\\n<li>The environment for the plugin to run in (see below)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here's an example of a very simple plugin that adds a static alias for the project's <code>Cargo.toml</code>, creates an about page, and prints the working directory at <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/tinker\\">tinker</a>-time (taken from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/plugins/src/plugin.rs\\">here</a>):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::plugins::{empty_control_actions_registrar, Plugin, PluginAction, PluginEnv};\\nuse perseus::Template;\\n\\n#[derive(Debug)]\\npub struct TestPluginData {\\n    pub about_page_greeting: String,\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_test_plugin&lt;G: perseus::Html&gt;() -&gt; Plugin&lt;G, TestPluginData&gt; {\\n    Plugin::new(\\n        &quot;test-plugin&quot;,\\n        |mut actions| {\\n            actions\\n                .settings_actions\\n                .add_static_aliases\\n                .register_plugin(&quot;test-plugin&quot;, |_, _| {\\n                    let mut map = std::collections::HashMap::new();\\n                    map.insert(&quot;/Cargo.toml&quot;.to_string(), &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;.to_string());\\n                    map\\n                });\\n            actions.settings_actions.add_templates.register_plugin(\\n                &quot;test-plugin&quot;,\\n                |_, plugin_data| {\\n                    if let Some(plugin_data) = plugin_data.downcast_ref::&lt;TestPluginData&gt;() {\\n                        let about_page_greeting = plugin_data.about_page_greeting.to_string();\\n                        // Note that this doesn't work with hydration, but a full template does (there's some difference there that causes a hydration ID overlap for some reason)\\n                        vec![Template::new(&quot;about&quot;)\\n                        .template(move |_| sycamore::view! { p { (about_page_greeting) } })\\n                        .head(|_| {\\n                            sycamore::view! {\\n                                title { &quot;About Page (Plugin Modified) | Perseus Example – Plugins&quot; }\\n                            }\\n                        })]\\n                    } else {\\n                        unreachable!()\\n                    }\\n                },\\n            );\\n            actions.tinker.register_plugin(&quot;test-plugin&quot;, |_, _| {\\n                println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, std::env::current_dir().unwrap());\\n                // This is completely pointless, but demonstrates how plugin dependencies can blow up binary sizes if they aren't made tinker-only plugins\\n                let test = &quot;[package]\\\\nname = \\\\&quot;test\\\\&quot;&quot;;\\n                let parsed: toml::Value = toml::from_str(test).unwrap();\\n                println!(&quot;{}&quot;, toml::to_string(&amp;parsed).unwrap());\\n            });\\n            actions\\n        },\\n        empty_control_actions_registrar,\\n        PluginEnv::Both,\\n    )\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>One particularly important thing to note here is the absence of any control actions in this plugin. Because you still have to provide a registrar, this function is using the <code>empty_control_actions_registrar</code> convenience function, which does exactly what its name implies.</p>\\n<p>Another notable thing is the presence of <code>GenericNode</code> as a type parameter, because some plugin actions take this, so you'll need to pass it through. We also tell Perseus what type of data out plugin will take in the second type parameter, which enables type checking in the <code>.plugin()</code> call when the user imports the plugin.</p>\\n<p>The rest of the code is the functional actions registrar, which just registers the plugin on the <code>functional_actions.settings_actions.add_static_aliases</code>, <code>functional_actions.settings_actions.add_templates</code>, and <code>functional_actions.tinker</code> actions. The functions provided to the <code>.register_plugin()</code> function are <em>runners</em>, which will be executed at the appropriate time by the Perseus engine. Runners take two parameters, <em>action data</em>, and <em>plugin data</em>. Action data are data provided to every runner for the given action (e.g. an action that runs after a failed build will be told what the error was). You should refer to <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/perseus\\">the API docs</a> to learn more about these for different actions. The second parameter is plugin data, covered below.</p>\\n<h2>Plugin Data</h2>\\n<p>Quite often, plugins should accept user configuration, and this is supported through the second runner parameter, which will be given any data that the user defined for your plugin. You can define the type of this with the second type parameter to <code>Plugin</code>.</p>\\n<p>However, because Perseus is juggling all the data for all the plugins the user has installed, across all their different runners, it can't store the type of the data that the user gives (but don't worry, whatever they provide will be type-checked). This means that your runner ends up being given what Rust considers to be <em>something</em>. Basically, <strong>we know that it's your plugin data, but Rust doesn't</strong>. Specifically, you'll be given <code>&amp;dyn Any</code>, which means you'll need to <em>downcast</em> this to a concrete type (the type of your plugin data). As in the above example, we can do this with <code>plugin_data.downcast_ref::&lt;YourPluginDataTypeHere&gt;()</code>, which will return an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. <strong>This will always be <code>Some</code></strong>, which is why it's perfectly safe to label the <code>None</code> branch as <code>unreachable!()</code>. If this ever does result in <code>None</code>, then either you've tried to downcast to something that's not your plugin's data type, or there's a critical bug in Perseus' plugins system, which you should <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new/choose\\">report to us</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\\n<p>Right now, there are few things that you can't do with Perseus plugins, which can be quite weird.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You can't extend the engine's server (due to a limitation of Actix Web types), you'll need to manually run a <code>tinker</code> on it (add your code into the file by writing it in using <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/tinker\\">the <code>tinker</code> action</a>)</li>\\n<li>You can't set the <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/stores\\">mutable store</a> from a plugin due to a traits issue, so you'll need to provide something for the user to set as a custom mutable store (see <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/stores/\\">here</a>)</li>\\n<li>Similarly, you can't set the translations manager from a plugin</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Plugin Environments</h2>\\n<p>As explained <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/using\\">here</a>, plugins can either run on the client (<code>PluginEnv::Client</code>), the server-side (<code>PluginEnv::Server</code>), or on both (<code>PluginEnv::Both</code>). Note that the server-side includes <code>tinker</code>-time and during the build process. If your plugin does not absolutely need to run on the client, use <code>PluginEnv::Server</code>! Your users will thank you for their much smaller bundles! If you don't do this, every single dependency of your plugin will end up in the user's final Wasm bundle, which has to be sent to browsers, and bundle sizes can end up doubling or more as a result! If this is the case though, make sure to tell your users to register your plugin using <code>.plugin_with_client_privilege()</code> rather than just <code>.plugin()</code> (but don't stress, they'll get an explanatory error if they use the wrong one accidentally).</p>\\n<p>You can set the environment your plugin runs on by changing the fourth argument to a variant of <code>PluginEnv</code>.</p>\\n","sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/intro\\">Introduction</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>Writing Perseus plugins is a relatively seamless process once you get the hang of the structure, and this section will guide you through the process. If you just want to use plugins, you can skip this section.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A plugin will usually occupy its own crate, but it may also be part of a larger app that just uses plugins for convenience and to avoid <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/ejecting">ejection</a>. The only thing you'll need in a plugin is the <code>perseus</code> crate, though you'll probably want to bring other libraries in (like <code>sycamore</code> if you're adding templates or error pages).</p>
<h2>Defining a Plugin</h2>
<p>To define a plugin, you'll call <code>perseus::plugins::Plugin::new()</code>, which takes four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the plugin as a <code>&amp;str</code>, which should be the name of the crate the plugin is in (or the name of a larger app with some extension) (<strong>all plugins MUST have unique names</strong>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/functional">functional actions</a> registrar function, which is given some functional actions and then extends them</li>
<li>A <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/control">control actions</a> registrar, which is given some control actions and then extends them</li>
<li>The environment for the plugin to run in (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of a very simple plugin that adds a static alias for the project's <code>Cargo.toml</code>, creates an about page, and prints the working directory at <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/tinker">tinker</a>-time (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/plugins/src/plugin.rs">here</a>):</p>

                        vec![Template::new(&quot;about&quot;)
                        .template(move |_| sycamore::view! { p { (about_page_greeting) } })

                            }
                        })]
                    } else {
                        unreachable!()
                    }
                },
            );
            actions.tinker.register_plugin(&quot;test-plugin&quot;, |_, _| {
                println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, std::env::current_dir().unwrap());
                // This is completely pointless, but demonstrates how plugin dependencies can blow up binary sizes if they aren't made tinker-only plugins
                let test = &quot;[package]\nname = \&quot;test\&quot;&quot;;
                let parsed: toml::Value = toml::from_str(test).unwrap();
                println!(&quot;{}&quot;, toml::to_string(&amp;parsed).unwrap());
            });
            actions
        },
        empty_control_actions_registrar,
        PluginEnv::Both,
    )
}

</code></pre>
<p>One particularly important thing to note here is the absence of any control actions in this plugin. Because you still have to provide a registrar, this function is using the <code>empty_control_actions_registrar</code> convenience function, which does exactly what its name implies.</p>
<p>Another notable thing is the presence of <code>GenericNode</code> as a type parameter, because some plugin actions take this, so you'll need to pass it through. We also tell Perseus what type of data out plugin will take in the second type parameter, which enables type checking in the <code>.plugin()</code> call when the user imports the plugin.</p>
<p>The rest of the code is the functional actions registrar, which just registers the plugin on the <code>functional_actions.settings_actions.add_static_aliases</code>, <code>functional_actions.settings_actions.add_templates</code>, and <code>functional_actions.tinker</code> actions. The functions provided to the <code>.register_plugin()</code> function are <em>runners</em>, which will be executed at the appropriate time by the Perseus engine. Runners take two parameters, <em>action data</em>, and <em>plugin data</em>. Action data are data provided to every runner for the given action (e.g. an action that runs after a failed build will be told what the error was). You should refer to <a href="https://docs.rs/perseus">the API docs</a> to learn more about these for different actions. The second parameter is plugin data, covered below.</p>
<h2>Plugin Data</h2>
<p>Quite often, plugins should accept user configuration, and this is supported through the second runner parameter, which will be given any data that the user defined for your plugin. You can define the type of this with the second type parameter to <code>Plugin</code>.</p>
<p>However, because Perseus is juggling all the data for all the plugins the user has installed, across all their different runners, it can't store the type of the data that the user gives (but don't worry, whatever they provide will be type-checked). This means that your runner ends up being given what Rust considers to be <em>something</em>. Basically, <strong>we know that it's your plugin data, but Rust doesn't</strong>. Specifically, you'll be given <code>&amp;dyn Any</code>, which means you'll need to <em>downcast</em> this to a concrete type (the type of your plugin data). As in the above example, we can do this with <code>plugin_data.downcast_ref::&lt;YourPluginDataTypeHere&gt;()</code>, which will return an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. <strong>This will always be <code>Some</code></strong>, which is why it's perfectly safe to label the <code>None</code> branch as <code>unreachable!()</code>. If this ever does result in <code>None</code>, then either you've tried to downcast to something that's not your plugin's data type, or there's a critical bug in Perseus' plugins system, which you should <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new/choose">report to us</a>.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Right now, there are few things that you can't do with Perseus plugins, which can be quite weird.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't extend the engine's server (due to a limitation of Actix Web types), you'll need to manually run a <code>tinker</code> on it (add your code into the file by writing it in using <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/tinker">the <code>tinker</code> action</a>)</li>
<li>You can't set the <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/stores">mutable store</a> from a plugin due to a traits issue, so you'll need to provide something for the user to set as a custom mutable store (see <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/stores/">here</a>)</li>
<li>Similarly, you can't set the translations manager from a plugin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plugin Environments</h2>
<p>As explained <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/plugins/using">here</a>, plugins can either run on the client (<code>PluginEnv::Client</code>), the server-side (<code>PluginEnv::Server</code>), or on both (<code>PluginEnv::Both</code>). Note that the server-side includes <code>tinker</code>-time and during the build process. If your plugin does not absolutely need to run on the client, use <code>PluginEnv::Server</code>! Your users will thank you for their much smaller bundles! If you don't do this, every single dependency of your plugin will end up in the user's final Wasm bundle, which has to be sent to browsers, and bundle sizes can end up doubling or more as a result! If this is the case though, make sure to tell your users to register your plugin using <code>.plugin_with_client_privilege()</code> rather than just <code>.plugin()</code> (but don't stress, they'll get an explanatory error if they use the wrong one accidentally).</p>
<p>You can set the environment your plugin runs on by changing the fourth argument to a variant of <code>PluginEnv</code>.</p>
