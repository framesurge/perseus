These steps can also serve as guidelines for production deployments.</p>\\n<p>Note that the following examples should be modified for your particular use-case rather than being used as-is. Also, these <code>Dockerfile</code>s are standalone because they use <code>curl</code> to download examples directly from the Perseus repository (of course, you'll probably want to use your own code in production).</p>\\n<p>Before proceeding with this section, you should be familiar with Docker's <a href=\\"https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build\\">multi-stage builds

<p>For situations where <a href="https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/deploying/serverful">serverful deployment</a> is required, or in case there is a need to deploy one of the examples found on GitHub without prior setup of all necessary dependencies, below are <code>Dockerfile</code> examples meant to serve for different deployment scenarios. These steps can also serve as guidelines for production deployments.</p>
<p>Note that the following examples should be modified for your particular use-case rather than being used as-is. Also, these <code>Dockerfile</code>s are standalone because they use <code>curl</code> to download examples directly from the Perseus repository (of course, you'll probably want to use your own code in production).</p>
<p>Before proceeding with this section, you should be familiar with Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build">multi-stage builds system</a> and Perseus' <a href="https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/deploying/size">code size optimizations</a>.</p>
