window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"State Amalgamation","content":"<h1>State Amalgamation</h1>\\n<p>In the introduction to this section, we mentioned that all these rendering strategies are compatible with one another, though we didn't explain how the two strategies that generate unique properties for a template can possible be compatible. That is, how can you use <em>build state</em> and <em>request state</em> in the same template? To our knowledge, Perseus is the only framework in the world (in any language) that supports using both, and it's made possible by <em>state amalgamation</em>, which lets you provide an arbitrary function that can merge conflicting states from these two strategies!</p>\\n<h2>Usage</h2>\\n<p>Here's an example from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/state_generation/src/templates/amalgamation.rs\\">here</a>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::{RenderFnResultWithCause, Request, States, Template};\\nuse sycamore::prelude::{view, Html, View};\\n\\n#[perseus::make_rx(PageStateRx)]\\npub struct PageState {\\n    pub message: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::template_rx]\\npub fn amalgamation_page(state: PageStateRx) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {\\n    view! {\\n        p { (format!(&quot;The message is: '{}'&quot;, state.message.get())) }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::new(&quot;amalgamation&quot;)\\n        // We'll generate some state at build time and some more at request time\\n        .build_state_fn(get_build_state)\\n        .request_state_fn(get_request_state)\\n        // But Perseus doesn't know which one to use, so we provide a function to unify them\\n        .amalgamate_states_fn(amalgamate_states)\\n        .template(amalgamation_page)\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(amalgamate_states)]\\npub fn amalgamate_states(states: States) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;Option&lt;PageState&gt;&gt; {\\n    // We know they'll both be defined, and Perseus currently has to provide both as serialized strings\\n    let build_state = serde_json::from_str::&lt;PageState&gt;(&amp;states.build_state.unwrap())?;\\n    let req_state = serde_json::from_str::&lt;PageState&gt;(&amp;states.request_state.unwrap())?;\\n\\n    Ok(Some(PageState {\\n        message: format!(\\n            &quot;Hello from the amalgamation! (Build says: '{}', server says: '{}'.)&quot;,\\n            build_state.message, req_state.message\\n        ),\\n    }))\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]\\npub async fn get_build_state(_path: String, _locale: String) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {\\n    Ok(PageState {\\n        message: &quot;Hello from the build process!&quot;.to_string(),\\n    })\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(request_state)]\\npub async fn get_request_state(\\n    _path: String,\\n    _locale: String,\\n    _req: Request,\\n) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {\\n    Ok(PageState {\\n        message: &quot;Hello from the server!&quot;.to_string(),\\n    })\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This example illustrates a very simple amalgamation, taking the states of both strategies to produce a new state that combines the two. Note that this also uses <code>RenderFnWithCause</code> as a return type (see the section on the <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/strategies/build-state\\"><em>build state</em></a> strategy for more information). It will be passed an instance of <code>States</code>, which you can learn more about in the <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/perseus\\">API docs</a>. As usual, serialization of your returned state is done with the <code>#[perseus::autoserde(amalgamate_states)]</code> macro, though the components of <code>States</code> will <strong>not</strong> be deserialized, and you'll have to do that manually. Note that the next major version of Perseus will deserialize the components of <code>States</code> automatically.</p>\\n","sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>In the introduction to this section, we mentioned that all these rendering strategies are compatible with one another, though we didn't explain how the two strategies that generate unique properties for a template can possible be compatible. That is, how can you use <em>build state</em> and <em>request state</em> in the same template? To our knowledge, Perseus is the only framework in the world (in any language) that supports using both, and it's made possible by <em>state amalgamation</em>, which lets you provide an arbitrary function that can merge conflicting states from these two strategies!</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here's an example from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/state_generation/src/templates/amalgamation.rs">here</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{RenderFnResultWithCause, Request, States, Template};
use sycamore::prelude::{view, Html, View};

#[perseus::make_rx(PageStateRx)]
pub struct PageState {
    pub message: String,
}

#[perseus::template_rx]
pub fn amalgamation_page(state: PageStateRx) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {
    view! {
        p { (format!(&quot;The message is: '{}'&quot;, state.message.get())) }
    }
}

pub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {
    Template::new(&quot;amalgamation&quot;)
        // We'll generate some state at build time and some more at request time
        .build_state_fn(get_build_state)
        .request_state_fn(get_request_state)
        // But Perseus doesn't know which one to use, so we provide a function to unify them
        .amalgamate_states_fn(amalgamate_states)
        .template(amalgamation_page)
}

#[perseus::autoserde(amalgamate_states)]
pub fn amalgamate_states(states: States) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;Option&lt;PageState&gt;&gt; {
    // We know they'll both be defined, and Perseus currently has to provide both as serialized strings
    let build_state = serde_json::from_str::&lt;PageState&gt;(&amp;states.build_state.unwrap())?;
    let req_state = serde_json::from_str::&lt;PageState&gt;(&amp;states.request_state.unwrap())?;

    Ok(Some(PageState {
        message: format!(
            &quot;Hello from the amalgamation! (Build says: '{}', server says: '{}'.)&quot;,
            build_state.message, req_state.message
        ),
    }))
}

#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]
pub async fn get_build_state(_path: String, _locale: String) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {
    Ok(PageState {
        message: &quot;Hello from the build process!&quot;.to_string(),
    })
}

#[perseus::autoserde(request_state)]
pub async fn get_request_state(
    _path: String,
    _locale: String,
    _req: Request,
) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {
    Ok(PageState {
        message: &quot;Hello from the server!&quot;.to_string(),
    })
}

</code></pre>
<p>This example illustrates a very simple amalgamation, taking the states of both strategies to produce a new state that combines the two. Note that this also uses <code>RenderFnWithCause</code> as a return type (see the section on the <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/reference/strategies/build-state"><em>build state</em></a> strategy for more information). It will be passed an instance of <code>States</code>, which you can learn more about in the <a href="https://docs.rs/perseus">API docs</a>. As usual, serialization of your returned state is done with the <code>#[perseus::autoserde(amalgamate_states)]</code> macro, though the components of <code>States</code> will <strong>not</strong> be deserialized, and you'll have to do that manually. Note that the next major version of Perseus will deserialize the components of <code>States</code> automatically.</p>
