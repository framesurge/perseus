window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"Build Paths","content":"<h1>Build Paths</h1>\\n<p>As touched on in the documentation on the <em>build state</em> strategy, Perseus can easily turn one template into many pages (e.g. one blog post template into many blog post pages) with the <em>build paths</em> strategy, which is a function that returns a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> of paths to build.</p>\\n<p>Note that it's often unwise to use this strategy to render all your blog posts or the like, but only render the top give most commonly accessed or the like, if any at all. This is relevant mostly when you have a large number of pages to be generated. The <em>incremental generation</em> strategy is better suited for this, and it also allows you to never need to rebuild your site for new content (as long as the server can access the new content).</p>\\n<p>Note that, like <em>build state</em>, this strategy may be invoked at build-time or while the server is running if you use the <em>revalidation</em> strategy (<em>incremental generation</em> doesn't affect <em>build paths</em> though).</p>\\n<h2>Usage</h2>\\n<p>Here's the same example as given in the previous section (taken from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/state_generation/src/templates/build_paths.rs\\">here</a>), which uses <em>build paths</em> together with <em>build state</em>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::{RenderFnResult, RenderFnResultWithCause, Template};\\nuse sycamore::prelude::{view, Html, View};\\n\\n#[perseus::make_rx(PageStateRx)]\\npub struct PageState {\\n    title: String,\\n    content: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::template_rx]\\npub fn build_paths_page(state: PageStateRx) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {\\n    let title = state.title;\\n    let content = state.content;\\n    view! {\\n        h1 {\\n            (title.get())\\n        }\\n        p {\\n            (content.get())\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::new(&quot;build_paths&quot;)\\n        .build_paths_fn(get_build_paths)\\n        .build_state_fn(get_build_state)\\n        .template(build_paths_page)\\n}\\n\\n// We'll take in the path here, which will consist of the template name \`build_paths\` followed by the spcific path we're building for (as exported from \`get_build_paths\`)\\n#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]\\npub async fn get_build_state(path: String, _locale: String) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {\\n    let title = path.clone();\\n    let content = format!(\\n        &quot;This is a post entitled '{}'. Its original slug was '{}'.&quot;,\\n        &amp;title, &amp;path\\n    );\\n\\n    Ok(PageState { title, content })\\n}\\n\\n// This just returns a vector of all the paths we want to generate for underneath \`build_paths\` (the template's name and root path)\\n// Like for build state, this function is asynchronous, so you could fetch these paths from a database or the like\\n// Note that everything you export from here will be prefixed with \`&lt;template-name&gt;/\` when it becomes a URL in your app\\n//\\n// Note also that there's almost no point in using build paths without build state, as every page would come out exactly the same (unless you differentiated them on the client...)\\npub async fn get_build_paths() -&gt; RenderFnResult&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; {\\n    Ok(vec![\\n        &quot;&quot;.to_string(),\\n        &quot;test&quot;.to_string(),\\n        &quot;blah/test/blah&quot;.to_string(),\\n    ])\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Note the return type of the <code>get_build_paths</code> function, which returns a <code>RenderFnResult&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, which is just an alias for <code>Result&lt;T, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt;</code>, which means that you can return any error you want. If you need to explicitly <code>return Err(..)</code>, then you should use <code>.into()</code> to perform the conversion from your error type to this type automatically. Perseus will then format your errors nicely for you using <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/fmterr\\"><code>fmterr</code></a>.</p>\\n<p>Also note how this page renders the page <code>/build_paths</code> by specifying an empty string as one of the paths exported from <code>get_build_paths</code>. It's a very common structure to have something like <code>/blog</code> and then <code>/blog/&lt;post-name&gt;</code> as a website structure, with <code>/blog</code> being a list of all posts or the like. However, Perseus would require this to all be done in the same template (since it's all under the same URL), so you'd need to use an <code>enum</code> as your state that would then render an alternative view for the root page. Alternatively, you could use a <code>/post/&lt;post-name&gt;</code> and <code>/posts</code> structure, which would let you use two different templates.</p>\\n","sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.4/intro\\">Introduction</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>As touched on in the documentation on the <em>build state</em> strategy, Perseus can easily turn one template into many pages (e.g. one blog post template into many blog post pages) with the <em>build paths</em> strategy, which is a function that returns a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> of paths to build.</p>
<p>Note that it's often unwise to use this strategy to render all your blog posts or the like, but only render the top give most commonly accessed or the like, if any at all. This is relevant mostly when you have a large number of pages to be generated. The <em>incremental generation</em> strategy is better suited for this, and it also allows you to never need to rebuild your site for new content (as long as the server can access the new content).</p>
<p>Note that, like <em>build state</em>, this strategy may be invoked at build-time or while the server is running if you use the <em>revalidation</em> strategy (<em>incremental generation</em> doesn't affect <em>build paths</em> though).</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here's the same example as given in the previous section (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/core/state_generation/src/templates/build_paths.rs">here</a>), which uses <em>build paths</em> together with <em>build state</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{RenderFnResult, RenderFnResultWithCause, Template};
use sycamore::prelude::{view, Html, View};

#[perseus::make_rx(PageStateRx)]
pub struct PageState {
    title: String,
    content: String,
}

#[perseus::template_rx]
pub fn build_paths_page(state: PageStateRx) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {
    let title = state.title;
    let content = state.content;
    view! {
        h1 {
            (title.get())
        }
        p {
            (content.get())
        }
    }
}

pub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {
    Template::new(&quot;build_paths&quot;)
        .build_paths_fn(get_build_paths)
        .build_state_fn(get_build_state)
        .template(build_paths_page)
}

// We'll take in the path here, which will consist of the template name `build_paths` followed by the spcific path we're building for (as exported from `get_build_paths`)
#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]
pub async fn get_build_state(path: String, _locale: String) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;PageState&gt; {
    let title = path.clone();
    let content = format!(
        &quot;This is a post entitled '{}'. Its original slug was '{}'.&quot;,
        &amp;title, &amp;path
    );

    Ok(PageState { title, content })
}

// This just returns a vector of all the paths we want to generate for underneath `build_paths` (the template's name and root path)
// Like for build state, this function is asynchronous, so you could fetch these paths from a database or the like
// Note that everything you export from here will be prefixed with `&lt;template-name&gt;/` when it becomes a URL in your app
//
// Note also that there's almost no point in using build paths without build state, as every page would come out exactly the same (unless you differentiated them on the client...)
pub async fn get_build_paths() -&gt; RenderFnResult&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    Ok(vec![
        &quot;&quot;.to_string(),
        &quot;test&quot;.to_string(),
        &quot;blah/test/blah&quot;.to_string(),
    ])
}

</code></pre>
<p>Note the return type of the <code>get_build_paths</code> function, which returns a <code>RenderFnResult&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, which is just an alias for <code>Result&lt;T, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt;</code>, which means that you can return any error you want. If you need to explicitly <code>return Err(..)</code>, then you should use <code>.into()</code> to perform the conversion from your error type to this type automatically. Perseus will then format your errors nicely for you using <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/fmterr"><code>fmterr</code></a>.</p>
<p>Also note how this page renders the page <code>/build_paths</code> by specifying an empty string as one of the paths exported from <code>get_build_paths</code>. It's a very common structure to have something like <code>/blog</code> and then <code>/blog/&lt;post-name&gt;</code> as a website structure, with <code>/blog</code> being a list of all posts or the like. However, Perseus would require this to all be done in the same template (since it's all under the same URL), so you'd need to use an <code>enum</code> as your state that would then render an alternative view for the root page. Alternatively, you could use a <code>/post/&lt;post-name&gt;</code> and <code>/posts</code> structure, which would let you use two different templates.</p>
