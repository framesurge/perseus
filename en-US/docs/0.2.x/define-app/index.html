<p>The core of Perseus is how it interacts with the CLI, which acts as the engine that runs your code. The bridge between these two systems is the <code>define_app!</code> macro, which accepts a number of options that define your app.</p>
<p>The smallest this can reasonably get is a fully self-contained app (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/tiny/src/lib.rs">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{define_app, ErrorPages, Template};
use std::rc::Rc;
use sycamore::template;
define_app! {
    templates: [
        Template::&lt;G&gt;::new(&quot;index&quot;).template(Rc::new(|_| {
            template! {
                p { &quot;Hello World!&quot; }
            }
        }))
    ],
    error_pages: ErrorPages::new(Rc::new(|url, status, err, _| {
        template! {
            p { (format!(&quot;An error with HTTP code {} occurred at '{}': '{}'.&quot;, status, url, err)) }
        }
    }))
}

</code></pre>
<p>In a more complex app though, this macro still remains very manageable (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/showcase/src/lib.rs">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod error_pages;
mod templates;

use perseus::define_app;

define_app! {
    templates: [
        crate::templates::index::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::about::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::new_post::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::post::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::ip::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::time_root::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::time::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::amalgamation::get_template::&lt;G&gt;()
    ],
    error_pages: crate::error_pages::get_error_pages(),
    locales: {
        default: &quot;en-US&quot;,
        other: [&quot;fr-FR&quot;, &quot;es-ES&quot;]
    }
}

</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>Here's a list of everything you can provide to the macro and what each one does (note that the order of these matters):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code> (optional) -- the HTML <code>id</code> to which your app will be rendered, the default is <code>root</code>; this MUST be reflected in your <code>index.html</code> file as an exact replication (spacing and all) of <code>&lt;div id=&quot;root-id-here&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> (replacing <code>root-id-here</code> with the value of this property)</li>
<li><code>templates</code> -- defines a list of your templates in which order is irrelevant</li>
<li><code>error_pages</code> -- defines an instance of <code>ErrorPages</code>, which tells Perseus what to do on an error (like a <em>404 Not Found</em>)</li>
<li><code>locales</code> (optional) -- defines options for i18n (internationalization), this shouldn't be specified for apps not using i18n
<ul>
<li><code>default</code> -- the default locale of your app (e.g. <code>en-US</code>)</li>
<li><code>other</code> -- a list of the other locales your app supports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>static_aliases</code> (optional) -- a list of aliases to static files in your project (e.g. for a favicon)</li>
<li><code>config_manager</code> (optional) -- a custom configuration manager</li>
<li><code>translations_manager</code> (optional) -- a custom translations manager</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if you try to include something from outside the current directory in <code>static_aliases</code>, <strong>no part of your app will load</strong>! If you could include such content, you might end up serving <code>/etc/passwd</code>, which would be a major security risk.</p>
<h2>Other Files</h2>
<p>There's only one other file that the <code>define_app!</code> macro expects to exist: <code>index.html</code>. Note that any content in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of this will be on every page, above anything inserted by the template.</p>
<p>Here's an example of this file (taken from <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/basic/index.html">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
