window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"content":"<h1>Routing</h1>\\n<p>Perseus' routing system is quite unique in that it's almost entirely <em>inferred</em>, meaning that you don't ever have to define a router or explain to the system which paths go where. Instead, they're inferred from templates in a system that's explained in detail in the <a href=\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.2.x/templates/intro\\">templates section</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Template Selection Algorithm</h2>\\n<p>Perseus has a very specific algorithm that it uses to determine which template to use for a given route, which is greatly dependent on <code>.perseus/dist/render_conf.json</code>. This is executed on the client-side for <em>subsequent loads</em> and on the server-side for <em>initial loads</em>.</p>\\n<p>Here's an example render configuration (for the <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/showcase\\">showcase example</a>), which maps path to template root path.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-json\\">{\\n    &quot;about&quot;: &quot;about&quot;,\\n    &quot;index&quot;: &quot;index&quot;,\\n    &quot;post/new&quot;: &quot;post/new&quot;,\\n    &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;ip&quot;,\\n    &quot;post/*&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,\\n    &quot;timeisr/test&quot;: &quot;timeisr&quot;,\\n    &quot;timeisr/*&quot;: &quot;timeisr&quot;,\\n    &quot;time&quot;: &quot;time&quot;,\\n    &quot;amalgamation&quot;: &quot;amalgamation&quot;,\\n    &quot;post/blah/test/blah&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,\\n    &quot;post/test&quot;: &quot;post&quot;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here are the algorithm's steps (see <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/packages/perseus/src/router.rs\\"><code>router.rs</code></a>):</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>If the path is empty, set it to <code>index</code> (which is used for the landing page).</li>\\n<li>Try to directly get the template name by trying the path as a key. This would work for anything not using incremental generation (in the above example, anything other than <code>post/*</code>).</li>\\n<li>Split the path into sections by <code>/</code> and iterate through them, performing the following on each section (iterating forwards from the beginning of the path, becoming more and more specific):\\n<ol>\\n<li>Make a path out of all segments up to the current point, adding <code>/*</code> at the end (indicative of incremental generation in the render configuration).</li>\\n<li>Try that as a key, return if it works.</li>\\n<li>Even if we have something, continue iterating until we have nothing. This way, we get the most specific path possible (and we can have incremental generation in incremental generation).</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Relationship with Sycamore's Router</h2>\\n<p>Sycamore has its own <a href=\\"https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/v0.6/advanced/routing\\">routing system</a>, which Perseus depends on extensively under the hood. This is evident in <code>.perseus/src/lib.rs</code>, which invokes the router. However, rather than using the traditional Sycamore approach of having an <code>enum</code> with variants for each possible route (which was the approach in Perseus v0.1.x), Perseus provides the router with a <code>struct</code> that performs routing logic and returns either <code>RouteVerdict::Found</code>, <code>RouteVerdict::LocaleDetection</code>, or <code>RouteVerdict::NotFound</code>. The render configuration is accessed through a global variable implanted in the user's HTML shell when the server initializes.</p>\\n","current_version":"0.2.x","manifest":{"0.1.x":{"docs_rs":"0.1","git":"v0.1.4","state":"outdated"},"0.2.x":{"docs_rs":"0.2","git":"v0.2.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.0-0.3.3":{"docs_rs":"0.3.3","git":"v0.3.3","state":"outdated"},"0.3.4":{"docs_rs":"0.3","git":"v0.3.6","state":"stable"},"0.4.x":{"docs_rs":"0.4.0-beta","git":"HEAD","state":"beta"}},"sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>Perseus' routing system is quite unique in that it's almost entirely <em>inferred</em>, meaning that you don't ever have to define a router or explain to the system which paths go where. Instead, they're inferred from templates in a system that's explained in detail in the <a href="https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.2.x/templates/intro">templates section</a>.</p>
<h2>Template Selection Algorithm</h2>
<p>Perseus has a very specific algorithm that it uses to determine which template to use for a given route, which is greatly dependent on <code>.perseus/dist/render_conf.json</code>. This is executed on the client-side for <em>subsequent loads</em> and on the server-side for <em>initial loads</em>.</p>
<p>Here's an example render configuration (for the <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/showcase">showcase example</a>), which maps path to template root path.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;about&quot;: &quot;about&quot;,
    &quot;index&quot;: &quot;index&quot;,
    &quot;post/new&quot;: &quot;post/new&quot;,
    &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;ip&quot;,
    &quot;post/*&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
    &quot;timeisr/test&quot;: &quot;timeisr&quot;,
    &quot;timeisr/*&quot;: &quot;timeisr&quot;,
    &quot;time&quot;: &quot;time&quot;,
    &quot;amalgamation&quot;: &quot;amalgamation&quot;,
    &quot;post/blah/test/blah&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
    &quot;post/test&quot;: &quot;post&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here are the algorithm's steps (see <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/packages/perseus/src/router.rs"><code>router.rs</code></a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>If the path is empty, set it to <code>index</code> (which is used for the landing page).</li>
<li>Try to directly get the template name by trying the path as a key. This would work for anything not using incremental generation (in the above example, anything other than <code>post/*</code>).</li>
<li>Split the path into sections by <code>/</code> and iterate through them, performing the following on each section (iterating forwards from the beginning of the path, becoming more and more specific):
<ol>
<li>Make a path out of all segments up to the current point, adding <code>/*</code> at the end (indicative of incremental generation in the render configuration).</li>
<li>Try that as a key, return if it works.</li>
<li>Even if we have something, continue iterating until we have nothing. This way, we get the most specific path possible (and we can have incremental generation in incremental generation).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Relationship with Sycamore's Router</h2>
<p>Sycamore has its own <a href="https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/v0.6/advanced/routing">routing system</a>, which Perseus depends on extensively under the hood. This is evident in <code>.perseus/src/lib.rs</code>, which invokes the router. However, rather than using the traditional Sycamore approach of having an <code>enum</code> with variants for each possible route (which was the approach in Perseus v0.1.x), Perseus provides the router with a <code>struct</code> that performs routing logic and returns either <code>RouteVerdict::Found</code>, <code>RouteVerdict::LocaleDetection</code>, or <code>RouteVerdict::NotFound</code>. The render configuration is accessed through a global variable implanted in the user's HTML shell when the server initializes.</p>
