window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"Hello World!","content":"<h1>Hello World!</h1>\\n<p>Let's get started with Perseus!</p>\\n<p><em>To follow along here, you'll want to be familiar with Rust, which you can learn more about <a href=\\"https://rust-lang.org\\">here</a>. You should also have it and <code>cargo</code> installed.</em></p>\\n<p>To begin, create a new folder for your project, let's call it <code>my-perseus-app</code>. Now, create a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file in that folder. This tells Rust which packages you want to use in your project and some other metadata. Put the following inside:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-toml\\">[package]\\nname = &quot;my-perseus-app&quot;\\nversion = &quot;0.1.0&quot;\\nedition = &quot;2018&quot;\\n\\n# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html\\n\\n[dependencies]\\nperseus = &quot;0.2&quot;\\nsycamore = &quot;0.6&quot;\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<details>\\n<summary>What are those dependencies doing?</summary>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>perseus</code> -- the core module for Perseus</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore\\"><code>sycamore</code></a> -- the amazing system on which Perseus is built, this allows you to write reactive web apps in Rust</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Note that we've set these dependencies up so that they'll automatically update <em>patch versions</em>, which means we'll get bug fixes automatically, but we won't get any updates that will break our app!</p>\\n</details>\\n<p>Now, create an <code>index.html</code> file at the root of your project and put the following inside:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-html\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;head&gt;\\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;\\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;\\n        &lt;title&gt;Perseus Example – Tiny&lt;/title&gt;\\n    &lt;/head&gt;\\n    &lt;body&gt;\\n        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/body&gt;\\n&lt;/html&gt;\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<details>\\n<summary>Why do I need an HTML file?</summary>\\n<p>Perseus aims to be as versatile as possible, and so it allows you to include your own <code>index.html</code> file, in which you can import things like fonts, analytics, etc.</p>\\n<p>This file MUST contain at least the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>&lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, which is where your app will be rendered, this must be a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with no other attributes except the <code>id</code>, and that spacing (that way parsing is lightweight and fast)</li>\\n<li>A <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is where HTML metadata goes (even if you don't have any metadata, Perseus still needs it)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Note also that we don't have to import anything to make Perseus run here, the server will do that automatically for us!</p>\\n</details>\\n<p>Now, create a new directory called <code>src</code> and add a new file inside called <code>lib.rs</code>. Put the following inside:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::{define_app, ErrorPages, Template};\\nuse std::rc::Rc;\\nuse sycamore::template;\\ndefine_app! {\\n    templates: [\\n        Template::&lt;G&gt;::new(&quot;index&quot;).template(Rc::new(|_| {\\n            template! {\\n                p { &quot;Hello World!&quot; }\\n            }\\n        }))\\n    ],\\n    error_pages: ErrorPages::new(Rc::new(|url, status, err, _| {\\n        template! {\\n            p { (format!(&quot;An error with HTTP code {} occurred at '{}': '{}'.&quot;, status, url, err)) }\\n        }\\n    }))\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<details>\\n<summary>How does that work?</summary>\\n<p>First, we import some things that'll be useful:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>perseus::{define_app, ErrorPages, Template}</code> -- the -<code>define_app!</code> macro, which tells Perseus how your app works; the <code>ErrorPages</code> <code>struct</code>, which lets you tell Perseus how to handle errors (like <em>404 Not Found</em> if the user goes to a nonexistent page); and the <code>Template</code> <code>struct</code>, which is how Perseus manages pages in your app</li>\\n<li><code>std::rc::Rc</code> -- a <a href=\\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html\\">reference-counted smart pointer</a> (you don't <em>have</em> to understand these to use Perseus, but reading that link would be helpful)</li>\\n<li><code>sycamore::template</code> -- Sycamore's [<code>template!</code> macro], which lets you write HTML-like code in Rust</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Then, we use the <code>define_app!</code> macro to declare the different aspects of the app, starting with the <em>templates</em>. We only have one template, which we've called <code>index</code> (a special name that makes it render at the root of your app), and then we define how that should look, creating a paragraph (<code>p</code>) containing the text <code>Hello World!</code>. Perseus does all kinds of clever stuff with this under the hood, and we put it in an <code>Rc</code> to enable that.</p>\\n<p>Finally, we tell Perseus what to do if something in your app fails, like if the user goes to a page that doesn't exist. This requires creating a new instance of <code>ErrorPages</code>, which is a <code>struct</code> that lets you define a separate error page for every <a href=\\"https://httpstatuses.com\\">HTTP status code</a>, as well as a fallback. Here, we've just defined the fallback. That page is given the URL that caused the error, the HTTP status code, and the actual error message, all of which we display with a Sycamore <code>template!</code>, with seamless interpolation.</p>\\n</details>\\n<p>Now install the Perseus CLI with <code>cargo install perseus-cli</code> (you'll need <code>wasm-pack</code> to let Perseus build your app, use <code>cargo install wasm-pack</code> to install it) to make your life way easier, and deploy your app to <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080\\">http://localhost:8080</a> by running <code>perseus serve</code> inside the root of your project! This will take a while the first time, because it's got to fetch all your dependencies and build your app.</p>\\n<details>\\n<summary>Why do I need a CLI?</summary>\\n<p>Perseus is a <em>very</em> complex system, and, if you had to write all that complexity yourself, that <em>Hello World!</em> example would be more like 1700 lines of code than 17! The CLI lets you abstract away all that complexity into a directory that you might have noticed appear called <code>.perseus/</code>. If you take a look inside, you'll actually find two crates (Rust packages): one for your app, and another for the server that serves your app. These are what actually run your app, and they import the code you've written. The <code>define_app!</code> macro defines a series of functions and constants at compile-time that make this possible.</p>\\n<p>When you run <code>perseus serve</code>, the <code>.perseus/</code> directory is created and added to your <code>.gitignore</code>, and then three stages occur in parallel (they're shown in your terminal):</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>🔨 Generating your app</em> -- here, your app is built to a series of static files in <code>.perseus/dist/static</code>, which makes your app lightning-fast (your app's pages are ready before it's even been deployed, which is called <em>static site generation</em>, or SSG)</li>\\n<li><em>🏗️ Building your app to Wasm</em> -- here, your app is built to <a href=\\"https://webassembly.org\\">WebAssembly</a>, which is what lets a low-level programming language like Rust run in the browser</li>\\n<li><em>📡 Building server</em> -- here, Perseus builds its internal server based on your code, and prepares to serve your app</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The first time you run this command, it can take quite a while to get everything ready, but after that it'll be really fast. And, if you haven't changed any code (<em>at all</em>) since you last ran it, you can run <code>perseus serve --no-build</code> to run the server basically instantaneously.</p>\\n</details>\\n<p>Once that's done, hop over to <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080\\">http://localhost:8080</a> in any modern browser (not Internet Explorer...), and you should see <em>Hello World!</em> printed on the screen! If you try going to <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080/about\\">http://localhost:8080/about</a> or any other page, you should see a message that tells you the page wasn't found.</p>\\n<p>Congratulations! You've just created your first ever Perseus app! You can see the source code for this section <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/tiny\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\\n<p>The next section creates a slightly more realistic app with more than just one file, which will show you how a Perseus app is usually structured.</p>\\n<p>After that, you'll learn how different features of Perseus work, like <em>incremental generation</em> (which lets you build pages on-demand at runtime)!</p>\\n<h3>Alternatives</h3>\\n<p>If you've gone through this and you aren't that chuffed with Perseus, here are some similar projects in Rust:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore\\">Sycamore</a> (without Perseus) -- <em>A reactive library for creating web apps in Rust and WebAssembly.</em></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/yewstack/yew\\">Yew</a> -- <em>Rust/Wasm framework for building client web apps.</em></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/seed-rs/seed\\">Seed</a> -- <em>A Rust framework for creating web apps.</em></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/chinedufn/percy\\">Percy</a> -- <em>Build frontend browser apps with Rust + WebAssembly.

<p>Let's get started with Perseus!</p>
<p><em>To follow along here, you'll want to be familiar with Rust, which you can learn more about <a href="https://rust-lang.org">here</a>. You should also have it and <code>cargo</code> installed.</em></p>
<p>To begin, create a new folder for your project, let's call it <code>my-perseus-app</code>. Now, create a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file in that folder. This tells Rust which packages you want to use in your project and some other metadata. Put the following inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-perseus-app&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2018&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
perseus = &quot;0.2&quot;
sycamore = &quot;0.6&quot;

</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>What are those dependencies doing?</summary>
<ul>
<li><code>perseus</code> -- the core module for Perseus</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore"><code>sycamore</code></a> -- the amazing system on which Perseus is built, this allows you to write reactive web apps in Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we've set these dependencies up so that they'll automatically update <em>patch versions</em>, which means we'll get bug fixes automatically, but we won't get any updates that will break our app!</p>
</details>
<p>Now, create an <code>index.html</code> file at the root of your project and put the following inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Perseus Example – Tiny&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>Why do I need an HTML file?</summary>
<p>Perseus aims to be as versatile as possible, and so it allows you to include your own <code>index.html</code> file, in which you can import things like fonts, analytics, etc.</p>
<p>This file MUST contain at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, which is where your app will be rendered, this must be a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with no other attributes except the <code>id</code>, and that spacing (that way parsing is lightweight and fast)</li>
<li>A <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is where HTML metadata goes (even if you don't have any metadata, Perseus still needs it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that we don't have to import anything to make Perseus run here, the server will do that automatically for us!</p>
</details>
<p>Now, create a new directory called <code>src</code> and add a new file inside called <code>lib.rs</code>. Put the following inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{define_app, ErrorPages, Template};
use std::rc::Rc;
use sycamore::template;
define_app! {
    templates: [
        Template::&lt;G&gt;::new(&quot;index&quot;).template(Rc::new(|_| {
            template! {
                p { &quot;Hello World!&quot; }
            }
        }))
    ],
    error_pages: ErrorPages::new(Rc::new(|url, status, err, _| {
        template! {
            p { (format!(&quot;An error with HTTP code {} occurred at '{}': '{}'.&quot;, status, url, err)) }
        }
    }))
}

</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>How does that work?</summary>
<p>First, we import some things that'll be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perseus::{define_app, ErrorPages, Template}</code> -- the -<code>define_app!</code> macro, which tells Perseus how your app works; the <code>ErrorPages</code> <code>struct</code>, which lets you tell Perseus how to handle errors (like <em>404 Not Found</em> if the user goes to a nonexistent page); and the <code>Template</code> <code>struct</code>, which is how Perseus manages pages in your app</li>
<li><code>std::rc::Rc</code> -- a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html">reference-counted smart pointer</a> (you don't <em>have</em> to understand these to use Perseus, but reading that link would be helpful)</li>
<li><code>sycamore::template</code> -- Sycamore's [<code>template!</code> macro], which lets you write HTML-like code in Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we use the <code>define_app!</code> macro to declare the different aspects of the app, starting with the <em>templates</em>. We only have one template, which we've called <code>index</code> (a special name that makes it render at the root of your app), and then we define how that should look, creating a paragraph (<code>p</code>) containing the text <code>Hello World!</code>. Perseus does all kinds of clever stuff with this under the hood, and we put it in an <code>Rc</code> to enable that.</p>
<p>Finally, we tell Perseus what to do if something in your app fails, like if the user goes to a page that doesn't exist. This requires creating a new instance of <code>ErrorPages</code>, which is a <code>struct</code> that lets you define a separate error page for every <a href="https://httpstatuses.com">HTTP status code</a>, as well as a fallback. Here, we've just defined the fallback. That page is given the URL that caused the error, the HTTP status code, and the actual error message, all of which we display with a Sycamore <code>template!</code>, with seamless interpolation.</p>
</details>
<p>Now install the Perseus CLI with <code>cargo install perseus-cli</code> (you'll need <code>wasm-pack</code> to let Perseus build your app, use <code>cargo install wasm-pack</code> to install it) to make your life way easier, and deploy your app to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> by running <code>perseus serve</code> inside the root of your project! This will take a while the first time, because it's got to fetch all your dependencies and build your app.</p>
<details>
<summary>Why do I need a CLI?</summary>
<p>Perseus is a <em>very</em> complex system, and, if you had to write all that complexity yourself, that <em>Hello World!</em> example would be more like 1700 lines of code than 17! The CLI lets you abstract away all that complexity into a directory that you might have noticed appear called <code>.perseus/</code>. If you take a look inside, you'll actually find two crates (Rust packages): one for your app, and another for the server that serves your app. These are what actually run your app, and they import the code you've written. The <code>define_app!</code> macro defines a series of functions and constants at compile-time that make this possible.</p>
<p>When you run <code>perseus serve</code>, the <code>.perseus/</code> directory is created and added to your <code>.gitignore</code>, and then three stages occur in parallel (they're shown in your terminal):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>🔨 Generating your app</em> -- here, your app is built to a series of static files in <code>.perseus/dist/static</code>, which makes your app lightning-fast (your app's pages are ready before it's even been deployed, which is called <em>static site generation</em>, or SSG)</li>
<li><em>🏗️ Building your app to Wasm</em> -- here, your app is built to <a href="https://webassembly.org">WebAssembly</a>, which is what lets a low-level programming language like Rust run in the browser</li>
<li><em>📡 Building server</em> -- here, Perseus builds its internal server based on your code, and prepares to serve your app</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time you run this command, it can take quite a while to get everything ready, but after that it'll be really fast. And, if you haven't changed any code (<em>at all</em>) since you last ran it, you can run <code>perseus serve --no-build</code> to run the server basically instantaneously.</p>
</details>
<p>Once that's done, hop over to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in any modern browser (not Internet Explorer...), and you should see <em>Hello World!</em> printed on the screen! If you try going to <a href="http://localhost:8080/about">http://localhost:8080/about</a> or any other page, you should see a message that tells you the page wasn't found.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've just created your first ever Perseus app! You can see the source code for this section <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/tiny">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>The next section creates a slightly more realistic app with more than just one file, which will show you how a Perseus app is usually structured.</p>
<p>After that, you'll learn how different features of Perseus work, like <em>incremental generation</em> (which lets you build pages on-demand at runtime)!</p>
