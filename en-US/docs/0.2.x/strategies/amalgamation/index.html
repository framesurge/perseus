That is, how can you use <em>build state</em> and <em>request state</em> in the same template? To our knowledge, Perseus is the only framework in the world (in any language) that supports using both, and it's made possible by <em>state amalgamation</em>, which lets you provide an arbitrary function that can merge conflicting states from these two strategies!</p>\\n<h2>Usage</h2>\\n<p>Here's an example from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/examples/showcase/src/templates/amalgamation.rs\\">here</a>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust,no_run,no-playground\\">use perseus::{Request, States, StringResultWithCause, Template};\\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\\nuse std::rc::Rc;\\nuse sycamore::prelude::{component, template, GenericNode, Template as SycamoreTemplate};\\n\\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\\npub struct AmalagamationPageProps {\\n    pub message: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[component(AboutPage&lt;G&gt;)]\\npub fn about_page(props: AmalagamationPageProps) -&gt; SycamoreTemplate&lt;G&gt; {\\n    template! {\\n        p { (format!(&quot;The message is: '{}'&quot;, props.message)) }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: GenericNode&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::new(&quot;amalgamation&quot;)\\n        .build_state_fn(Rc::new(get_build_state))\\n        .request_state_fn(Rc::new(get_request_state))\\n        .amalgamate_states_fn(Rc::new(amalgamate_states))\\n        .template(template_fn())\\n}\\n\\npub fn amalgamate_states(states: States) -&gt; StringResultWithCause&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;&gt; {\\n    // We know they'll both be defined\\n    let build_state =\\n        serde_json::from_str::&lt;AmalagamationPageProps&gt;(&amp;states.build_state.unwrap()).unwrap();\\n    let req_state =\\n        serde_json::from_str::&lt;AmalagamationPageProps&gt;(&amp;states.request_state.unwrap()).unwrap();\\n\\n    Ok(Some(\\n        serde_json::to_string(&amp;AmalagamationPageProps {\\n            message: format!(\\n                &quot;Hello from the amalgamation!

Note that this also uses <code>StringResultWithCause</code> as a return type (see the section on the <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.2.x/strategies/build-state\\"><em>build state</em></a> strategy for more information). It will be passed an instance of <code>States</code>, which you can learn more about in the <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/perseus\\">API

<p>In the introduction to this section, we mentioned that all these rendering strategies are compatible with one another, though we didn't explain how the two strategies that generate unique properties for a template can possible be compatible. That is, how can you use <em>build state</em> and <em>request state</em> in the same template? To our knowledge, Perseus is the only framework in the world (in any language) that supports using both, and it's made possible by <em>state amalgamation</em>, which lets you provide an arbitrary function that can merge conflicting states from these two strategies!</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>This example illustrates a very simple amalgamation, taking the states of both strategies to produce a new state that combines the two. Note that this also uses <code>StringResultWithCause</code> as a return type (see the section on the <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.2.x/strategies/build-state"><em>build state</em></a> strategy for more information). It will be passed an instance of <code>States</code>, which you can learn more about in the <a href="https://docs.rs/perseus">API docs</a>.</p>
