These steps can also serve as guidelines for production deployments.</p>\\n<p>Note that the following examples should be modified for your particular use-case rather than being used as-is. Also, these <code>Dockerfile</code>s are standalone because they use <code>curl</code> to download examples directly from the Perseus repository (of course, you'll probably want to use your own code in production).</p>\\n<p>Before proceeding with this section, you should be familiar with Docker's <a href=\\"https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build\\">multi-stage builds

These steps can also serve as guidelines for production deployments.<p>Note that the following examples should be modified for your particular use-case rather than being used as-is. Also, these <code>Dockerfile</code>s are standalone because they use <code>curl</code> to download examples directly from the Perseus repository (of course, you'll probably want to use your own code in production).<p>Before proceeding with this section, you should be familiar with Docker's <a href=https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build>multi-stage builds system</a> and Perseus' <a href=https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.0-0.3.3/deploying/size>code size optimizations</a>.<details><summary>Production example using the size optimizations plugin</summary> <pre><code class=language-dockerfile># get the base image
