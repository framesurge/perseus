<p>The first type of action that a Perseus plugin can take is a functional action, and a single functional action can be taken by many plugins. These are the more common type of Perseus action, and are extremely versatile in extending the capabilities of the Perseus engine. However, they don't have the ability to replace critical functionality on their own.</p>
<h2>List of Functional Actions</h2>
<p>Here's a list of all the functional actions currently supported by Perseus, which will likely grow over time. You can see these in <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/packages/perseus/src/plugins/functional.rs">this file</a> in the Perseus repository.</p>
<p>If you'd like to request that a new action, functional or control, be added, please <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new/choose">open an issue</a>.</p>
