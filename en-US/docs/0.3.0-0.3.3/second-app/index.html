window.__PERSEUS_INITIAL_STATE = `{"title":"Your Second App","content":"<h1>Your Second App</h1>\\n<p>This section will cover building a more realistic app than the <em>Hello World!</em> section, with proper structuring and multiple templates.</p>\\n<p>If learning by reading isn't really your thing, or you'd like a reference, you can see all the code in <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/v0.3.3/examples/basic\\">this repository</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Setup</h2>\\n<p>Much like the <em>Hello World!</em> app, we'll start off by creating a new directory for the project, maybe <code>my-second-perseus-app</code> (or you could exercise imagination...). Then, we'll create a new <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and fill it with the following:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-toml\\">[package]\\nname = &quot;my-second-perseus-app&quot;\\nversion = &quot;0.1.0&quot;\\nedition = &quot;2018&quot;\\n\\n# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html\\n\\n[dependencies]\\nperseus = { version = &quot;0.3.3&quot;, features = [ &quot;hydrate&quot; ] }\\nsycamore = &quot;0.7&quot;\\nserde = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }\\nserde_json = &quot;1&quot;\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The only difference between this and the last <code>Cargo.toml</code> we created is two new dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://serde.rs\\"><code>serde</code></a> -- a really useful Rust library for serializing/deserializing data</li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/serde-rs/json\\"><code>serde_json</code></a> -- Serde's integration for JSON, which lets us pass around properties for more advanced pages in Perseus (you may not explicitly use this, but you'll need it as a dependency for some Perseus macros)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The next thing to do is to create <code>index.html</code>, which is pretty much the same as last time:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-html\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;head&gt;\\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;\\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;\\n    &lt;/head&gt;\\n    &lt;body&gt;\\n        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/body&gt;\\n&lt;/html&gt;\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The only notable difference here is the absence of a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, which is because we'll be creating it inside Perseus! Any Perseus template can modify the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document, but anything you put into <code>index.html</code> will persist across all pages. We don't want to have conflicting titles, so we leave that property out of <code>index.html</code>.</p>\\n<h2><code>lib.rs</code></h2>\\n<p>As in every Perseus app, <code>lib.rs</code> is how we communicate with the CLI and tell it how our app works. Put the following content in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">mod error_pages;\\nmod templates;\\n\\nuse perseus::define_app;\\n\\ndefine_app! {\\n    templates: [\\n        crate::templates::index::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),\\n        crate::templates::about::get_template::&lt;G&gt;()\\n    ],\\n    error_pages: crate::error_pages::get_error_pages(),\\n    static_aliases: {\\n        &quot;/test.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;static/test.txt&quot;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This code is quite different from your first app, so let's go through how it works.</p>\\n<p>First, we define two other modules in our code: <code>error_pages</code> (at <code>src/error_pages.rs</code>) and <code>templates</code> (at <code>src/templates</code>). Don't worry, we'll create those in a moment. The rest of the code creates a new app with two templates, which are expected to be in the <code>src/templates</code> directory. Note the use of <code>&lt;G&gt;</code> here, which is a Rust <em>type parameter</em> (the <code>get_template</code> function can work for the browser or the server, so Rust needs to know which one it is). This parameter is <em>ambient</em> to the <code>templates</code> key, which means you can use it without declaring it as long as you're inside <code>templates: {...}</code>. This will be set to <code>DomNode</code> for the browser and <code>SsrNode</code> for the server, but that all happens behind the scenes.</p>\\n<p>Also note that we're pulling in our error pages from another file as well (in a larger app you may even want to have a different file for each error page).</p>\\n<p>The last thing we do is new, we define <code>static_aliases</code> to map the URL <code>/test.txt</code> in our app to the file <code>static/test.txt</code>. This feature is detailed in more depth later, but it can be extremely useful, for example for defining your site's logo (or favicon), which browsers expect to be available at <code>/favicon.ico</code>. Create the <code>static/test.txt</code> file now (<code>static/</code> should NOT be inside <code>src/</code>!) and fill it with whatever you want.</p>\\n<h2>Error Handling</h2>\\n<p>Before we get to the cool part of building the actual pages of the app, we should set up error pages again, which we'll do in <code>src/error_pages.rs</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::{ErrorPages, Html};\\nuse sycamore::view;\\n\\npub fn get_error_pages&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; ErrorPages&lt;G&gt; {\\n    let mut error_pages = ErrorPages::new(|url, status, err, _| {\\n        view! {\\n            p { (format!(&quot;An error with HTTP code {} occurred at '{}': '{}'.&quot;, status, url, err)) }\\n        }\\n    });\\n    error_pages.add_page(404, |_, _, _, _| {\\n        view! {\\n            p { &quot;Page not found.&quot; }\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\n    error_pages\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is a little more advanced than the last time we did this, and there are a few things we should note.</p>\\n<p>The first is the import of <a href=\\"https://docs.rs/sycamore/0.7/sycamore/generic_node/trait.Html.html\\"><code>Html</code></a>, which we define as a type parameter on the <code>get_error_pages</code> function. This makes sure that we can compile these views on the client or the server as long as they're targeting HTML (Sycamore can also target other templating formats for completely different systems, like macOS desktop apps).</p>\\n<p>In this function, we also define a different error page for a 404 error, which will occur when a user tries to go to a page that doesn't exist. The fallback page (which we initialize <code>ErrorPages</code> with) is the same as last time, and will be called for any errors other than a <em>404 Not Found</em>.</p>\\n<h2><code>index.rs</code></h2>\\n<p>It's time to create the first page for this app! But first, we need to make sure that import in <code>src/lib.rs</code> of <code>mod templates;</code> works, which requires us to create a new file <code>src/templates/mod.rs</code>, which declares <code>src/templates</code> as a module with its own code. Add the following to that file:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">pub mod about;\\npub mod index;\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It's common practice to have a file for each <em>template</em>, which is slightly different to a page (explained in more detail later), and this app has two pages: a landing page (index) and an about page.</p>\\n<p>Let's begin with the landing page. Create a new file <code>src/templates/index.rs</code> and put the following inside:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::{\\n    http::header::{HeaderMap, HeaderName},\\n    Html, RenderFnResultWithCause, SsrNode, Template,\\n};\\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\\nuse sycamore::prelude::{component, view, View};\\n\\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\\npub struct IndexPageProps {\\n    pub greeting: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]\\n#[component(IndexPage&lt;G&gt;)]\\npub fn index_page(props: IndexPageProps) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {\\n    view! {\\n        p {(props.greeting)}\\n        a(href = &quot;about&quot;, id = &quot;about-link&quot;) { &quot;About!&quot; }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::new(&quot;index&quot;)\\n        .build_state_fn(get_build_props)\\n        .template(index_page)\\n        .head(head)\\n        .set_headers_fn(set_headers)\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::head]\\npub fn head(_props: IndexPageProps) -&gt; View&lt;SsrNode&gt; {\\n    view! {\\n        title { &quot;Index Page | Perseus Example – Basic&quot; }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]\\npub async fn get_build_props(\\n    _path: String,\\n    _locale: String,\\n) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;IndexPageProps&gt; {\\n    Ok(IndexPageProps {\\n        greeting: &quot;Hello World!&quot;.to_string(),\\n    })\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::autoserde(set_headers)]\\npub fn set_headers(props: Option&lt;IndexPageProps&gt;) -&gt; HeaderMap {\\n    let mut map = HeaderMap::new();\\n    map.insert(\\n        HeaderName::from_lowercase(b&quot;x-greeting&quot;).unwrap(),\\n        props.unwrap().greeting.parse().unwrap(),\\n    );\\n    map\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This code is <em>much</em> more complex than the <em>Hello World!</em> example, so let's go through it carefully.</p>\\n<p>First, we import a whole ton of stuff:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>perseus</code>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>RenderFnResultWithCause</code> -- see below for an explanation of this</li>\\n<li><code>Template</code> -- as before</li>\\n<li><code>Html</code> -- as before (this is from Sycamore, but is re-exported by Perseus for convenience)</li>\\n<li><code>http::header::{HeaderMap, HeaderName}</code> -- some types for adding HTTP headers to our page</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><code>serde</code>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>Serialize</code> -- a trait for <code>struct</code>s that can be turned into a string (like JSON)</li>\\n<li><code>Deserialize</code> -- a trait for <code>struct</code>s that can be <em>de</em>serialized from a string (like JSON)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><code>sycamore</code>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>component</code> -- a macro that turns a function into a Sycamore component</li>\\n<li><code>view</code> -- the <code>view!</code> macro, same as before</li>\\n<li><code>View</code> -- the output of the <code>view!</code> macro</li>\\n<li><code>SsrNode</code> -- Sycamore's representation of a node that will only be rendered on the server (this is re-exported from Perseus as well for convenience)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Then we define a number of different functions and a <code>struct</code>, each of which gets a section now.</p>\\n<h3><code>IndexPageProps</code></h3>\\n<p>This <code>struct</code> represents the properties that the index page will take. In this case, we're building an index page that will display a greeting defined in this, specifically in the <code>greeting</code> property.</p>\\n<p>Any template can take arguments in Perseus, which should always be given inside a <code>struct</code>. For simplicity and performance, Perseus only ever passes your properties around as a <code>String</code>, so you'll need to serialize/deserialize them yourself (as in the functions below).</p>\\n<h3><code>index_page()</code></h3>\\n<p>This is the actual component that your page is. By annotating it with <code>#[component(IndexPage&lt;G&gt;)]</code>, we tell Sycamore to turn it into a complex <code>struct</code> that can be called inside <code>view!</code> (which we do in <code>template_fn()</code>), and the <code>#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]</code> tells Perseus to do a little bit of work behind the scenes so that you can use <code>index_page</code> directly in the later <code>.template()</code> call. In previous versions of Perseus, you needed to do that boilerplate work yourself.</p>\\n<p>Note that <code>index_page()</code> takes <code>IndexPageProps</code> as an argument, which it can then access in the <code>view!</code>. This is Sycamore's interpolation system, which you can read about <a href=\\"https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/basics/template\\">here</a>, but all you need to know is that it's basically seamless and works exactly as you'd expect.</p>\\n<p>The only other thing we do here is define an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (an HTML link) to <code>/about</code>. This link, and any others you define, will automatically be detected by Sycamore's systems, which will pass them to Perseus' routing logic, which means your users <strong>never leave the page</strong>. In this way, Perseus only pulls in the content that needs to change, and gives your users the feeling of a lightning-fast and weightless app.</p>\\n<p><em>Note: external links will automatically be excluded from this, and you can exclude manually by adding <code>rel=&quot;external&quot;</code> if you need.</em></p>\\n<h3><code>head()</code></h3>\\n<p>This function is very similar to <code>index_page()</code>, except that it isn't a fully fledged Sycamore component, it just returns a <code>view! {}</code> instead. What this is used for is to define the content of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is metadata for your website, like its <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. As you can see, this is given the properties that <code>index_page()</code> takes, but we aren't using them for anything in this example. The <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro tells Perseus to do some boilerplate work behind the scenes that's very similar to that done with <code>index_page</code>, but specialized for the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\\n<p>What's really important to note about this function is that it only renders to an <code>SsrNode</code>, which means you cannot use reactivity in here! Whatever is rendered the first time will be turned into a <code>String</code> and then statically interpolated into the document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\\n<p>The difference between metadata defined here and metadata defined in your <code>index.html</code> file is that the latter will apply to every page, while this will only apply to the template. So, this is more useful for things like titles, while you might use <code>index.html</code> to import stylesheets or analytics.</p>\\n<p>If you inspect the source code of the HTML in your browser, you'll find a big comment in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> that says <code>&lt;!--PERSEUS_INTERPOLATED_HEAD_BEGINS--&gt;</code>, that separates the stuff that should remain the same on every page from the stuff that should update for each page.</p>\\n<h3><code>get_template()</code></h3>\\n<p>This function is what we call in <code>lib.rs</code>, and it combines everything else in this file to produce an actual Perseus <code>Template</code> to be used. Note the name of the template as <code>index</code>, which Perseus interprets as special, which causes this template to be rendered at <code>/</code> (the landing page).</p>\\n<p>Perseus' templating system is extremely versatile, and here we're using it to define our page itself through <code>.template()</code>, and to define a function that will modify the document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> (which allows us to add a title) with <code>.head()</code>. Notably, we also use the <em>build state</em> rendering strategy, which tells Perseus to call the <code>get_build_props()</code> function when your app builds to get some state. More on that in a moment.</p>\\n<h4><code>.template()</code></h4>\\n<p>This function is what Perseus will call when it wants to render your template (which it does more than you might think). If you've used the <code>#[perseus::template(...)]</code> macro on <code>index_page()</code>, you can provide <code>index_page</code> directly here, but it can be useful to understand what that macro is doing.</p>\\n<p>Behind the scenes, that macro transforms your <code>index_page()</code> function to take properties as an <code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code> instead of as <code>IndexPageProps</code>, because Perseus actually passes your properties around internally as <code>String</code>s. At first, this might seem weird, but it avoids a few common problems that would increase your final Wasm binary size and make your website take a very long time to load. Interestingly, it's actually also more performant to use <code>String</code>s everywhere, because we need to perform that conversion anyway when we send your properties to a user's browser.</p>\\n<p>If that all went over your head, don't worry, that's just what Perseus does behind the scenes, and what you used to have to do by hand! The <code>#[perseus::template(...)]</code> macro does all that for you now.</p>\\n<h4><code>.head()</code></h4>\\n<p>This is just the equivalent of <code>.template()</code> for the <code>head()</code> function, and it does basically the exact same thing. The only particular thing of note here is that the properties this expects are again as an <code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code>, and those are deserialized automatically by the <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro that we used on <code>head()</code> earlier.</p>\\n<h3><code>get_build_props()</code></h3>\\n<p>This function is part of Perseus' secret sauce (actually <em>open</em> sauce), and it will be called when the CLI builds your app to create properties that the template will take (it expects a string, hence the serialization). Here, we just hard-code a greeting in to be used, but the real power of this comes when you start using the fact that this function is <code>async</code>. You might query a database to get a list of blog posts, or pull in a Markdown documentation page and parse it, the possibilities are endless!</p>\\n<p>This function returns a rather special type, <code>RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;IndexPageProps&gt;</code>, which declares that your function will return <code>IndexPageProps</code> if it succeeds, and a special error if it fails. That error can be anything you want (it's a <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> internally), but it will also have a blame assigned to it that records whether it was the server or the client that caused the error, which will impact the final HTTP status code. You can use the <code>blame_err!</code> macro to create these errors easily, but any time you use <code>?</code> in functions that return this type will simply use the default of blaming the server and returning an HTTP status code of <em>500 Internal Server Error</em>.</p>\\n<p>It may seem a little pointless to blame the client in the build process, but the reason this can happen is because, in more advanced uses of Perseus (particularly <a href=\\"https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.0-0.3.3/strategies/incremental\\">incremental generation</a>), this function could be called as a result of a client's request with parameters that it provides, which could be invalid. Essentially, know that it's a thing that's important in more complex use-cases of Perseus.</p>\\n<p>That <code>#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]</code> is also something you'll see quite a lot of (but not in older versions of Perseus). It's a convenience macro that automatically serializes the return of your function to a <code>String</code> for Perseus to use internally, which is basically just the opposite of the <code>#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]</code> annotation we used earlier. You don't technically need this, but it eliminates some boilerplate code that you don't need to bother writing yourself.</p>\\n<h3><code>set_headers_fn()</code></h3>\\n<p>This function represents a very powerful feature of Perseus, the ability to set any <a href=\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers\\">HTTP headers</a> for a given template. In this case, any time the Perseus server successfully returns our template to the browser, it will call this function on the HTTP response just before it sends it, which will add our custom header <code>x-test</code>, setting it to the value <code>custom value</code>.</p>\\n<p>Note that this function has its own special return type, and that <code>HeaderMap</code> is distinct from other types, like a <code>HashMap</code>.</p>\\n<h2><code>about.rs</code></h2>\\n<p>Okay! We're past the hump, and now it's time to define the (much simpler) <code>/about</code> page. Create <code>src/templates/about.rs</code> and put the following inside:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">use perseus::Template;\\nuse sycamore::prelude::{component, view, Html, SsrNode, View};\\n\\n#[perseus::template(AboutPage)]\\n#[component(AboutPage&lt;G&gt;)]\\npub fn about_page() -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {\\n    view! {\\n        p { &quot;About.&quot; }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n#[perseus::head]\\npub fn head() -&gt; View&lt;SsrNode&gt; {\\n    view! {\\n        title { &quot;About Page | Perseus Example – Basic&quot; }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {\\n    Template::new(&quot;about&quot;).template(about_page).head(head)\\n}\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is basically exactly the same as <code>index.rs</code>, except we don't have any properties to deal with, and we don't need to generate anything special at build time (but Perseus will still render this page to static HTML, ready to be served to your users).</p>\\n<h2>Running It</h2>\\n<p><code>perseus serve</code></p>\\n<p>That's all. Every time you build a Perseus app, that's all you need to do.</p>\\n<p>Once this is finished, your app will be live at <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080\\">http://localhost:8080</a>! Note that if you don't like that, you can change the host/port with the <code>HOST</code>/<code>PORT</code> environment variables (e.g. you'd want to set the host to <code>0.0.0.0</code> if you want other people on your network to be able to access your site).</p>\\n<p>Hop over to <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080\\">http://localhost:8080</a> in any modern browser and you should see your greeting <code>Hello World!</code> above a link to the about page! if you click that link, you'll be taken to a page that just says <code>About.</code>, but notice how your browser seemingly never navigates to a new page (the tab doesn't show a loading icon)? That's Perseus' <em>app shell</em> in action, which intercepts navigation to other pages and makes it occur seamlessly, only fetching the bare minimum to make the new page load. The same behavior will occur if you use your browser's forward/backward buttons.</p>\\n<details>\\n<summary>Why a 'modern browser'?</summary>\\n<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>\\n<p>Perseus is compatible with any browser that supports Wasm, which is most modern browsers like Firefox and Chrome. However, legacy browsers like Internet Explorer will not work with any Perseus app, unless you <em>polyfill</em> support for WebAssembly.</p>\\n</details>\\n<p>By the way, remember this little bit of code in <code>src/lib.rs</code>?</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\"language-rust\\">    static_aliases: {\\n        &quot;/test.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;static/test.txt&quot;\\n    }\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you navigate to <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080/test.txt\\">http://localhost:8080/test.txt</a>, you should see the contents on <code>static/test.txt</code>! You can also access them at <a href=\\"http://localhost:8080/.perseus/static/test.txt\\">http://localhost:8080/.perseus/static/test.txt</a></p>\\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\\n<p>Congratulations! You're now well on your way to building highly performant web apps in Rust! The remaining sections of this book are more reference-style, and won't guide you through building an app, but they'll focus instead on specific features of Perseus that can be used to make extremely powerful systems.</p>\\n<p>So go forth, and build!</p>\\n","sidebar_content":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

<p>This section will cover building a more realistic app than the <em>Hello World!</em> section, with proper structuring and multiple templates.</p>
<p>If learning by reading isn't really your thing, or you'd like a reference, you can see all the code in <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/v0.3.3/examples/basic">this repository</a>!</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Much like the <em>Hello World!</em> app, we'll start off by creating a new directory for the project, maybe <code>my-second-perseus-app</code> (or you could exercise imagination...). Then, we'll create a new <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and fill it with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my-second-perseus-app&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2018&quot;

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
perseus = { version = &quot;0.3.3&quot;, features = [ &quot;hydrate&quot; ] }
sycamore = &quot;0.7&quot;
serde = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }
serde_json = &quot;1&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>The only difference between this and the last <code>Cargo.toml</code> we created is two new dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://serde.rs"><code>serde</code></a> -- a really useful Rust library for serializing/deserializing data</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/json"><code>serde_json</code></a> -- Serde's integration for JSON, which lets us pass around properties for more advanced pages in Perseus (you may not explicitly use this, but you'll need it as a dependency for some Perseus macros)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next thing to do is to create <code>index.html</code>, which is pretty much the same as last time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>The only notable difference here is the absence of a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, which is because we'll be creating it inside Perseus! Any Perseus template can modify the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document, but anything you put into <code>index.html</code> will persist across all pages. We don't want to have conflicting titles, so we leave that property out of <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<h2><code>lib.rs</code></h2>
<p>As in every Perseus app, <code>lib.rs</code> is how we communicate with the CLI and tell it how our app works. Put the following content in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod error_pages;
mod templates;

use perseus::define_app;

define_app! {
    templates: [
        crate::templates::index::get_template::&lt;G&gt;(),
        crate::templates::about::get_template::&lt;G&gt;()
    ],
    error_pages: crate::error_pages::get_error_pages(),
    static_aliases: {
        &quot;/test.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;static/test.txt&quot;
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>This code is quite different from your first app, so let's go through how it works.</p>
<p>First, we define two other modules in our code: <code>error_pages</code> (at <code>src/error_pages.rs</code>) and <code>templates</code> (at <code>src/templates</code>). Don't worry, we'll create those in a moment. The rest of the code creates a new app with two templates, which are expected to be in the <code>src/templates</code> directory. Note the use of <code>&lt;G&gt;</code> here, which is a Rust <em>type parameter</em> (the <code>get_template</code> function can work for the browser or the server, so Rust needs to know which one it is). This parameter is <em>ambient</em> to the <code>templates</code> key, which means you can use it without declaring it as long as you're inside <code>templates: {...}</code>. This will be set to <code>DomNode</code> for the browser and <code>SsrNode</code> for the server, but that all happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Also note that we're pulling in our error pages from another file as well (in a larger app you may even want to have a different file for each error page).</p>
<p>The last thing we do is new, we define <code>static_aliases</code> to map the URL <code>/test.txt</code> in our app to the file <code>static/test.txt</code>. This feature is detailed in more depth later, but it can be extremely useful, for example for defining your site's logo (or favicon), which browsers expect to be available at <code>/favicon.ico</code>. Create the <code>static/test.txt</code> file now (<code>static/</code> should NOT be inside <code>src/</code>!) and fill it with whatever you want.</p>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>Before we get to the cool part of building the actual pages of the app, we should set up error pages again, which we'll do in <code>src/error_pages.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{ErrorPages, Html};
use sycamore::view;

pub fn get_error_pages&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; ErrorPages&lt;G&gt; {
    let mut error_pages = ErrorPages::new(|url, status, err, _| {
        view! {
            p { (format!(&quot;An error with HTTP code {} occurred at '{}': '{}'.&quot;, status, url, err)) }
        }
    });
    error_pages.add_page(404, |_, _, _, _| {
        view! {
            p { &quot;Page not found.&quot; }
        }
    });

    error_pages
}

</code></pre>
<p>This is a little more advanced than the last time we did this, and there are a few things we should note.</p>
<p>The first is the import of <a href="https://docs.rs/sycamore/0.7/sycamore/generic_node/trait.Html.html"><code>Html</code></a>, which we define as a type parameter on the <code>get_error_pages</code> function. This makes sure that we can compile these views on the client or the server as long as they're targeting HTML (Sycamore can also target other templating formats for completely different systems, like macOS desktop apps).</p>
<p>In this function, we also define a different error page for a 404 error, which will occur when a user tries to go to a page that doesn't exist. The fallback page (which we initialize <code>ErrorPages</code> with) is the same as last time, and will be called for any errors other than a <em>404 Not Found</em>.</p>
<h2><code>index.rs</code></h2>
<p>It's time to create the first page for this app! But first, we need to make sure that import in <code>src/lib.rs</code> of <code>mod templates;</code> works, which requires us to create a new file <code>src/templates/mod.rs</code>, which declares <code>src/templates</code> as a module with its own code. Add the following to that file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub mod about;
pub mod index;

</code></pre>
<p>It's common practice to have a file for each <em>template</em>, which is slightly different to a page (explained in more detail later), and this app has two pages: a landing page (index) and an about page.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the landing page. Create a new file <code>src/templates/index.rs</code> and put the following inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::{
    http::header::{HeaderMap, HeaderName},
    Html, RenderFnResultWithCause, SsrNode, Template,
};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use sycamore::prelude::{component, view, View};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct IndexPageProps {
    pub greeting: String,
}

#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]
#[component(IndexPage&lt;G&gt;)]
pub fn index_page(props: IndexPageProps) -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {
    view! {
        p {(props.greeting)}
        a(href = &quot;about&quot;, id = &quot;about-link&quot;) { &quot;About!&quot; }
    }
}

pub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {
    Template::new(&quot;index&quot;)
        .build_state_fn(get_build_props)
        .template(index_page)
        .head(head)
        .set_headers_fn(set_headers)
}

#[perseus::head]
pub fn head(_props: IndexPageProps) -&gt; View&lt;SsrNode&gt; {
    view! {
        title { &quot;Index Page | Perseus Example – Basic&quot; }
    }
}

#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]
pub async fn get_build_props(
    _path: String,
    _locale: String,
) -&gt; RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;IndexPageProps&gt; {
    Ok(IndexPageProps {
        greeting: &quot;Hello World!&quot;.to_string(),
    })
}

#[perseus::autoserde(set_headers)]
pub fn set_headers(props: Option&lt;IndexPageProps&gt;) -&gt; HeaderMap {
    let mut map = HeaderMap::new();
    map.insert(
        HeaderName::from_lowercase(b&quot;x-greeting&quot;).unwrap(),
        props.unwrap().greeting.parse().unwrap(),
    );
    map
}

</code></pre>
<p>This code is <em>much</em> more complex than the <em>Hello World!</em> example, so let's go through it carefully.</p>
<p>First, we import a whole ton of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perseus</code>
<ul>
<li><code>RenderFnResultWithCause</code> -- see below for an explanation of this</li>
<li><code>Template</code> -- as before</li>
<li><code>Html</code> -- as before (this is from Sycamore, but is re-exported by Perseus for convenience)</li>
<li><code>http::header::{HeaderMap, HeaderName}</code> -- some types for adding HTTP headers to our page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>serde</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Serialize</code> -- a trait for <code>struct</code>s that can be turned into a string (like JSON)</li>
<li><code>Deserialize</code> -- a trait for <code>struct</code>s that can be <em>de</em>serialized from a string (like JSON)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>sycamore</code>
<ul>
<li><code>component</code> -- a macro that turns a function into a Sycamore component</li>
<li><code>view</code> -- the <code>view!</code> macro, same as before</li>
<li><code>View</code> -- the output of the <code>view!</code> macro</li>
<li><code>SsrNode</code> -- Sycamore's representation of a node that will only be rendered on the server (this is re-exported from Perseus as well for convenience)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we define a number of different functions and a <code>struct</code>, each of which gets a section now.</p>
<h3><code>IndexPageProps</code></h3>
<p>This <code>struct</code> represents the properties that the index page will take. In this case, we're building an index page that will display a greeting defined in this, specifically in the <code>greeting</code> property.</p>
<p>Any template can take arguments in Perseus, which should always be given inside a <code>struct</code>. For simplicity and performance, Perseus only ever passes your properties around as a <code>String</code>, so you'll need to serialize/deserialize them yourself (as in the functions below).</p>
<h3><code>index_page()</code></h3>
<p>This is the actual component that your page is. By annotating it with <code>#[component(IndexPage&lt;G&gt;)]</code>, we tell Sycamore to turn it into a complex <code>struct</code> that can be called inside <code>view!</code> (which we do in <code>template_fn()</code>), and the <code>#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]</code> tells Perseus to do a little bit of work behind the scenes so that you can use <code>index_page</code> directly in the later <code>.template()</code> call. In previous versions of Perseus, you needed to do that boilerplate work yourself.</p>
<p>Note that <code>index_page()</code> takes <code>IndexPageProps</code> as an argument, which it can then access in the <code>view!</code>. This is Sycamore's interpolation system, which you can read about <a href="https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/basics/template">here</a>, but all you need to know is that it's basically seamless and works exactly as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The only other thing we do here is define an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (an HTML link) to <code>/about</code>. This link, and any others you define, will automatically be detected by Sycamore's systems, which will pass them to Perseus' routing logic, which means your users <strong>never leave the page</strong>. In this way, Perseus only pulls in the content that needs to change, and gives your users the feeling of a lightning-fast and weightless app.</p>
<p><em>Note: external links will automatically be excluded from this, and you can exclude manually by adding <code>rel=&quot;external&quot;</code> if you need.</em></p>
<h3><code>head()</code></h3>
<p>This function is very similar to <code>index_page()</code>, except that it isn't a fully fledged Sycamore component, it just returns a <code>view! {}</code> instead. What this is used for is to define the content of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is metadata for your website, like its <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. As you can see, this is given the properties that <code>index_page()</code> takes, but we aren't using them for anything in this example. The <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro tells Perseus to do some boilerplate work behind the scenes that's very similar to that done with <code>index_page</code>, but specialized for the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>What's really important to note about this function is that it only renders to an <code>SsrNode</code>, which means you cannot use reactivity in here! Whatever is rendered the first time will be turned into a <code>String</code> and then statically interpolated into the document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The difference between metadata defined here and metadata defined in your <code>index.html</code> file is that the latter will apply to every page, while this will only apply to the template. So, this is more useful for things like titles, while you might use <code>index.html</code> to import stylesheets or analytics.</p>
<p>If you inspect the source code of the HTML in your browser, you'll find a big comment in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> that says <code>&lt;!--PERSEUS_INTERPOLATED_HEAD_BEGINS--&gt;</code>, that separates the stuff that should remain the same on every page from the stuff that should update for each page.</p>
<h3><code>get_template()</code></h3>
<p>This function is what we call in <code>lib.rs</code>, and it combines everything else in this file to produce an actual Perseus <code>Template</code> to be used. Note the name of the template as <code>index</code>, which Perseus interprets as special, which causes this template to be rendered at <code>/</code> (the landing page).</p>
<p>Perseus' templating system is extremely versatile, and here we're using it to define our page itself through <code>.template()</code>, and to define a function that will modify the document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> (which allows us to add a title) with <code>.head()</code>. Notably, we also use the <em>build state</em> rendering strategy, which tells Perseus to call the <code>get_build_props()</code> function when your app builds to get some state. More on that in a moment.</p>
<h4><code>.template()</code></h4>
<p>This function is what Perseus will call when it wants to render your template (which it does more than you might think). If you've used the <code>#[perseus::template(...)]</code> macro on <code>index_page()</code>, you can provide <code>index_page</code> directly here, but it can be useful to understand what that macro is doing.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, that macro transforms your <code>index_page()</code> function to take properties as an <code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code> instead of as <code>IndexPageProps</code>, because Perseus actually passes your properties around internally as <code>String</code>s. At first, this might seem weird, but it avoids a few common problems that would increase your final Wasm binary size and make your website take a very long time to load. Interestingly, it's actually also more performant to use <code>String</code>s everywhere, because we need to perform that conversion anyway when we send your properties to a user's browser.</p>
<p>If that all went over your head, don't worry, that's just what Perseus does behind the scenes, and what you used to have to do by hand! The <code>#[perseus::template(...)]</code> macro does all that for you now.</p>
<h4><code>.head()</code></h4>
<p>This is just the equivalent of <code>.template()</code> for the <code>head()</code> function, and it does basically the exact same thing. The only particular thing of note here is that the properties this expects are again as an <code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code>, and those are deserialized automatically by the <code>#[perseus::head]</code> macro that we used on <code>head()</code> earlier.</p>
<h3><code>get_build_props()</code></h3>
<p>This function is part of Perseus' secret sauce (actually <em>open</em> sauce), and it will be called when the CLI builds your app to create properties that the template will take (it expects a string, hence the serialization). Here, we just hard-code a greeting in to be used, but the real power of this comes when you start using the fact that this function is <code>async</code>. You might query a database to get a list of blog posts, or pull in a Markdown documentation page and parse it, the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>This function returns a rather special type, <code>RenderFnResultWithCause&lt;IndexPageProps&gt;</code>, which declares that your function will return <code>IndexPageProps</code> if it succeeds, and a special error if it fails. That error can be anything you want (it's a <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> internally), but it will also have a blame assigned to it that records whether it was the server or the client that caused the error, which will impact the final HTTP status code. You can use the <code>blame_err!</code> macro to create these errors easily, but any time you use <code>?</code> in functions that return this type will simply use the default of blaming the server and returning an HTTP status code of <em>500 Internal Server Error</em>.</p>
<p>It may seem a little pointless to blame the client in the build process, but the reason this can happen is because, in more advanced uses of Perseus (particularly <a href="https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/0.3.0-0.3.3/strategies/incremental">incremental generation</a>), this function could be called as a result of a client's request with parameters that it provides, which could be invalid. Essentially, know that it's a thing that's important in more complex use-cases of Perseus.</p>
<p>That <code>#[perseus::autoserde(build_state)]</code> is also something you'll see quite a lot of (but not in older versions of Perseus). It's a convenience macro that automatically serializes the return of your function to a <code>String</code> for Perseus to use internally, which is basically just the opposite of the <code>#[perseus::template(IndexPage)]</code> annotation we used earlier. You don't technically need this, but it eliminates some boilerplate code that you don't need to bother writing yourself.</p>
<h3><code>set_headers_fn()</code></h3>
<p>This function represents a very powerful feature of Perseus, the ability to set any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a> for a given template. In this case, any time the Perseus server successfully returns our template to the browser, it will call this function on the HTTP response just before it sends it, which will add our custom header <code>x-test</code>, setting it to the value <code>custom value</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this function has its own special return type, and that <code>HeaderMap</code> is distinct from other types, like a <code>HashMap</code>.</p>
<h2><code>about.rs</code></h2>
<p>Okay! We're past the hump, and now it's time to define the (much simpler) <code>/about</code> page. Create <code>src/templates/about.rs</code> and put the following inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use perseus::Template;
use sycamore::prelude::{component, view, Html, SsrNode, View};

#[perseus::template(AboutPage)]
#[component(AboutPage&lt;G&gt;)]
pub fn about_page() -&gt; View&lt;G&gt; {
    view! {
        p { &quot;About.&quot; }
    }
}

#[perseus::head]
pub fn head() -&gt; View&lt;SsrNode&gt; {
    view! {
        title { &quot;About Page | Perseus Example – Basic&quot; }
    }
}

pub fn get_template&lt;G: Html&gt;() -&gt; Template&lt;G&gt; {
    Template::new(&quot;about&quot;).template(about_page).head(head)
}

</code></pre>
<p>This is basically exactly the same as <code>index.rs</code>, except we don't have any properties to deal with, and we don't need to generate anything special at build time (but Perseus will still render this page to static HTML, ready to be served to your users).</p>
<h2>Running It</h2>
<p><code>perseus serve</code></p>
<p>That's all. Every time you build a Perseus app, that's all you need to do.</p>
<p>Once this is finished, your app will be live at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>! Note that if you don't like that, you can change the host/port with the <code>HOST</code>/<code>PORT</code> environment variables (e.g. you'd want to set the host to <code>0.0.0.0</code> if you want other people on your network to be able to access your site).</p>
<p>Hop over to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in any modern browser and you should see your greeting <code>Hello World!</code> above a link to the about page! if you click that link, you'll be taken to a page that just says <code>About.</code>, but notice how your browser seemingly never navigates to a new page (the tab doesn't show a loading icon)? That's Perseus' <em>app shell</em> in action, which intercepts navigation to other pages and makes it occur seamlessly, only fetching the bare minimum to make the new page load. The same behavior will occur if you use your browser's forward/backward buttons.</p>
<details>
<summary>Why a 'modern browser'?</summary>
<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
<p>Perseus is compatible with any browser that supports Wasm, which is most modern browsers like Firefox and Chrome. However, legacy browsers like Internet Explorer will not work with any Perseus app, unless you <em>polyfill</em> support for WebAssembly.</p>
</details>
<p>By the way, remember this little bit of code in <code>src/lib.rs</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    static_aliases: {
        &quot;/test.txt&quot; =&gt; &quot;static/test.txt&quot;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>If you navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/test.txt">http://localhost:8080/test.txt</a>, you should see the contents on <code>static/test.txt</code>! You can also access them at <a href="http://localhost:8080/.perseus/static/test.txt">http://localhost:8080/.perseus/static/test.txt</a></p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You're now well on your way to building highly performant web apps in Rust! The remaining sections of this book are more reference-style, and won't guide you through building an app, but they'll focus instead on specific features of Perseus that can be used to make extremely powerful systems.</p>
<p>So go forth, and build!</p>
