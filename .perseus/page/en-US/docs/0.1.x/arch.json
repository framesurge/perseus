{"state":"{\"title\":\"Architecture\",\"content\":\"<h1>Architecture</h1>\\n<p>Perseus is a complex system, and this page will aim to explain the basics in a beginner-friendly way. If you've already used similar frameworks from the JS world like NextJS, then some of this may be familiar to you. If you're having trouble following along, please <a href=\\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new/choose\\\">open an issue</a> and ask us to clarify some sections, because this page in particular should be accessible to everyone. If you'd like more specific help, <a href=\\\"\\\">ask on Gitter</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Templates and Pages</h2>\\n<p>The core of Perseus is the idea of templates. When you create a Perseus app, what you're basically doing is telling Perseus how to compile your code into a series of <em>pages</em>. <strong>Each page has a unique URL on your final website.</strong> If you have a blog, and every post is stored as something like <code>post/title</code>, then each post would be a unique page.</p>\\n<p>But this doesn't mean you have to write the code for every page individually! Perseus does this for you, and only asks you to write <em>templates</em>. A template can generate one page or many, and a great example of one would be a <code>post</code> template. Each template has a <em>root path</em>, which is essentially like the space on your website that that template controls. For example, a post template might control <code>/post</code>, meaning it can render pages at <code>/post</code>, <code>/post/test</code>, <code>/post/longer/path</code>, etc. In theory, a template could render pages outside its domain, but this would be a bad idea for structure, and makes your code difficult to understand.</p>\\n<h3>State</h3>\\n<p>What differentiates pages from templates is <em>state</em>, which tells a page how to fill out its template to give unique content. For example, our post template would probably have a <code>content</code> field in its state, and its pages would use that to render their unique content!</p>\\n<p>In terms of writing code, a page's state is just a <code>struct</code> that can be serialized and deserialized with <a href=\\\"https://serde.rs\\\">Serde</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Rendering Strategies</h2>\\n<p>Each template has a rendering strategy, which it uses to create its pages. There are a number of rendering strategies in Perseus, each of which is documented in detail in its own section. What's important to understand for now is that there are two main ways a template can render pages, at <em>build time</em>, or at <em>request time</em>. If a template renders at build time, it generates the code for your pages when you build your app, which means you end up serving static pages. This is <em>really fast</em>. However, sometimes you need information specific to each request to render a page (e.g. an authentication token), and you can't render at build. Instead, you'd render at request time, which gives you access to information about the HTTP request a user sent for your page.</p>\\n<p>Here's a list of Perseus' currently supported rendering strategies. These can all be combined, but some combinations make more sense than others.</p>\\n<table><thead><tr><th>Strategy</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody>\\n<tr><td>Build paths</td><td>Generates a series of pages for a template</td><td>Build</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Build state</td><td>Generates page state</td><td>Build</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Request state</td><td>Generates page state</td><td>Request</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Revalidation</td><td>Rebuilds pages conditionally</td><td>Hybrid</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Incremental generation</td><td>Builds pages on-demand</td><td>Hybrid</td></tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<p>There are two <em>hybrid</em> strategies listed above. They're a little more complicated, and out of the scope of this page, but they operate at both build <em>and</em> request-time, allowing you to reap the benefits of both worlds!</p>\\n<h2>Routing</h2>\\n<p><em>This section describes how Perseus works under the hood. Skip it if you want.</em></p>\\n<p>Perseus doesn't just host your pages at their URLs though. In fact, Perseus has a generic handler for <em>any URL</em>, which returns what we call the <em>app shell</em>. That's a concept from the single-page app (e.g. ReactJS), where your app always has a constant shell around it, and each page is loaded into that shell, making page transitions more seamless. Perseus adopts this as well, but with the added benefits of super-fast static rendering strategies and a more lightweight shell.</p>\\n<p>The shell includes a router (courtesy of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore\\\">Sycamore</a>), which determines what page the user wants, and then sends a request to a special endpoint behind <code>/.perseus</code>. That then renders the page and returns some static HTML and the page's state.</p>\\n\",\"sidebar_content\":\"<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/intro\\\">Introduction</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/setup\\\">Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/arch\\\">Architecture</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/intro\\\">Building Your First App</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/setup\\\">Installation and Setup</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/template\\\">Writing Your First Template</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/tutorials/first_app/app\\\">Setting up the App Itself</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/cli\\\">CLI</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/templates\\\">Templates</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/routing\\\">Routing</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/error_pages\\\">Error Pages</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/intro\\\">Rendering Strategies</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_paths\\\">Build Paths</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/build_state\\\">Build State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/request_state\\\">Request State</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/revalidation\\\">Revalidation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/strategies/incremental\\\">Incremental generation</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/building\\\">Building</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/serving\\\">Serving</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/integrations/actix-web\\\">Actix Web Integration</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.1.x/config_managers\\\">Config Managers</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\",\"status\":\"Outdated\",\"manifest\":{\"0.3.4\":{\"state\":\"stable\",\"git\":\"v0.3.6\",\"docs_rs\":\"0.3\"},\"0.4.x\":{\"state\":\"beta\",\"git\":\"HEAD\",\"docs_rs\":\"0.4.0-beta\"},\"0.2.x\":{\"state\":\"outdated\",\"git\":\"v0.2.3\",\"docs_rs\":\"0.2\"},\"0.3.0-0.3.3\":{\"state\":\"outdated\",\"git\":\"v0.3.3\",\"docs_rs\":\"0.3.3\"},\"0.1.x\":{\"state\":\"outdated\",\"git\":\"v0.1.4\",\"docs_rs\":\"0.1\"}},\"current_version\":\"0.1.x\"}","head":"<title>Architecture | Perseus Docs</title><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".perseus/static/styles/markdown.css\"/><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".perseus/static/styles/docs_links_markdown.css\"/><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".perseus/static/prism.css\"/>"}
