## Features

- `live-reload` -- enables reloading the browser automatically when you make changes to your app
- `hsr` -- enables *hot state reloading*, which reloads the state of your app right before you made code changes in development, allowing you to pick up where you left off

## Packages

This is the API documentation for the `perseus-macro` package, which manages Perseus' procedural macros. Note that Perseus mostly uses [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US) for
documentation, and this should mostly be used as a secondary reference source. You can also find full usage examples [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples).

/// The new version of `#[template]` designed for reactive state. This can

/// anything other than an optional custom type parameter letter (by default,
/// `G` will be used). Unlike with the original macro, this will automatically
/// handle component names internally.
///
/// The first argument your template function can take is state generated for it
/// (e.g. by the *build state* strategy), but the reactive version (created with
/// `#[make_rx]` usually). From this, Perseus can infer the other required types
/// and automatically make your state reactive for you.
///
/// The second argument your template function can take is a global state
/// generated with the `GlobalStateCreator`. You should also provide the
/// reactive type here, and Perseus will do all the rest in the background.
///
/// Labels a function as a Perseus template, automatically managing its state
/// and integrating it into your app. Functions annotated with this macro
/// take at least one argument for Sycamore's reactive scope, and then a
/// possible other argument for some state they generate with a rendering
/// strategy (e.g. *build state*, generated when you build your app, see the
/// book for more). That state is expected to be reactive (see [`make_rx`]),
/// although, if you use `#[template(unreactive)]`, you can use any state that
/// has been annotated with [`UnreactiveState`] to make it clear to Perseus not
/// to expect something reactive.
///
/// Although you can make a Perseus app without using this macro, this isn't
/// recommended, since Perseus passes around state in your app as `String`s and
/// `dyn Any`s, meaning there is a large amount of overhead to actually using
/// the state you expect. This macro will automatically handle all that overhead
/// for you, making the process of building your app *significantly* smoother!
///
/// *Note: in previous versions of Perseus, there was a `template_rx` macro,
/// which has become this. The old unreactive `template` macro has become
/// `#[template(unreactive)]`. For those used to using Sycamore `#[component]`
/// annotation on their pages, this is no longer required. Note also that global
