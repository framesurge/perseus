## Features

- `live-reload` -- enables reloading the browser automatically when you make changes to your app
- `hsr` -- enables *hot state reloading*, which reloads the state of your app right before you made code changes in development, allowing you to pick up where you left off

## Packages

This is the API documentation for the `perseus-macro` package, which manages Perseus' procedural macros. Note that Perseus mostly uses [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US) for
documentation, and this should mostly be used as a secondary reference source. You can also find full usage examples [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples).
