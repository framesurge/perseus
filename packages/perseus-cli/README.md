# Perseus CLI

This is the official [Perseus](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus) CLI for making building and serving apps significantly easier! You can install it like so:

```
cargo install perseus-cli
```

And you'll then have an executable called `perseus` on your system!

If you're new to Perseus, you should check out [the core package](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus) first.
