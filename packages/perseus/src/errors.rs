/// **Important:** any changes to this `enum` constitute a breaking change,
/// since users match this in their error pages. Changes in underlying
/// `enum`s are not considered breaking (e.g. introducing a new invariant
/// error).
///
/// **Warning:** in all these cases, except `ClientError::ServerError`, the user
/// can already see the prerendered version of the page, it just isn't
/// interactive. Only in that case will your error page occupy the entire
/// screen, otherwise it will be placed into a `div` with the class
/// `__perseus-error`, a deliberate choice to reinforce the best practice of
/// giving the user as much as possible (it might not be interactive, but they
/// can still use a rudimentary version). See the book for further details.
///
/// # Panic handling
/// In a rather unorthodox manner, Perseus will do its level best to get an
/// error message to the user of your app, no matter what happens. For this
/// reason, this `enum` includes a `Panic` variant that will be provided when a
/// panic has been intercepted. In this case, your error view will be rendered
/// with no reactor, translations, or anything else available to it. What you do
/// at this time is extremely important, since any panics in the code that
/// handles that variant **cannot be caught**, leaving the user with no error
/// message and an app that has completely frozen.
///
/// The `Panic` variant on this type only provides a formatted panic message,
/// and nothing else from [`std::panic::PanicInfo`], due to lifetime
/// constraints. Since the message formatting is done by the standard library,
/// which automatically takes account of the `payload` and `message`, the only
/// other properties are `location` and `can_unwind`: the latter should be
/// handled by Perseus if it ever is, and the former shoudl not be exposed to
/// end users. Currently, there is no way to get the underlying `PanicInfo`
/// through Perseus' error handling system (although a plugin could do it
/// by overriding the panic handler, but this is usually a bad idea).
