    /// This method is implemented on the `Capsule`, which is already associated

    /// static for the engine-side using `SsrNode`, and another for the

    /// may be out of sync. Hence, this function uses a shadow parameter `H`
    /// with the same bounds as `G`, and confirms that the two are equal,
    /// then performing a low-cost byte-level copy and transmutation to
    /// assert the types as equal for the compiler.
