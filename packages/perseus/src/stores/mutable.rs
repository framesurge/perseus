/// A trait for implementations of stores that the Perseus engine can use for
/// mutable data, which may need to be altered while the server is running. In
/// exported apps, this is irrelevant, since there is no server process to speak
/// of. This store is used in particular by the revalidation and incremental
/// generation strategies, which will both update build artifacts for future
/// caching. By default, [`FsMutableStore`] is used for simplicity and low
/// latency, though this is only viable in deployments with writable
/// filesystems. Notably, this precludes usage in serverless functions.
///
/// However, this is written deliberately as a trait with exposed, isolated
/// error types (see [`StoreError`]), so that users can write their own
/// implementations of this. For instance, you could manage mutable artifacts in
/// a database, though this should be as low-latency as possible, since reads
/// and writes are required at extremely short-notice as new user requests
/// arrive.
///
/// **Warning:** the `NotFound` error is integral to Perseus' internal
/// operation, and must be returned if an asset does not exist. Do NOT return
/// any other error if everything else worked, but an asset simply did not
/// exist, or the entire render system will come crashing down around you!
