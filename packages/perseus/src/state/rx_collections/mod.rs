//! This module contains implementations of common Rust collections that work
//! well with Perseus' reactive state platform. So that this is as extensible as
//! possible, all the code in this module follows a general pattern, so that you
//! can easily create your own implementations as necessary!
//!
//! First, it is important to understand that each type has two versions:
//! `Collection` and `CollectionNested`. The former works with elements that
//! will be simply wrapped in `RcSignal`s, while the latter expects its elements
//! to implement `MakeRx` etc. This difference can be extremely useful for
//! users, because sometimes you'll want a vector of some reactive `struct`,
//! while other times you'll just want a vector of `String`s.
//!
//! Second, each reactive collection is a thin wrapper over the basic
//! collection. For example, [`RxVecNested`] is defined as `struct
//! RxVecNested<T>(Vec<T>)`, with several constraints on `T`.
//!
//! Third, each reactive collection has itself two types: `RxCollection` and
//! `RxCollectionRx`. The former is the base, unreactive collections, while the
//! latter is fully reactive. This is just like how the
//! `#[derive(ReactiveState)]` macro creates an alias type `MyStateRx`
//! for some state `MyState`. Note that these `struct`s should have the same
//! type bounds on `T`.
//!
//! Fourth, the unreactive types will have to implement `Serialize` and
//! `Deserialize`, from Serde. You can get this working by *omitting* the
//! `Serialize + DeserializeOwned` bounds on `T` in the unreactive type
//! definition, and by then letting the derive macros from Serde fill
//! them in automatically. Note the use of `DeserializeOwned` in type bounds,
//! which avoids lifetime concerns and HRTBs.
//!
//! Finally, every file in this module follows the same code pattern, allowing
//! maximal extensibility and self-documentation:
//!
//! ```
//! // --- Type definitions ---
//! // ...
//! // --- Reactivity implementations ---
//! // ...
//! // --- Dereferencing ---
//! // ...
//! // --- Conversion implementation ---
//! // ...
//! // --- Freezing implementation ---
//! // ...
//! ```
//!
//! The *type definitions* section contains the actual definitions of the
//! reactive and unreactive collection types, while the *reactivity
//! implementations* section contains the implementations of `MakeRx` for the
//! unreactive type, and `MakeUnrx` for the reactive type.
//!
//! The *dereferencing* section contains implementations that allow users to use
//! the methods of the underlying collection on these wrapper types. For
//! example, by implementing `Deref` with a target of `Vec<T::Rx>` for
//! `RxVecNestedRx<T>`, users can take that reactive type and call methods like
//! `.iter()` on it.
//!
//! The *conversion implementation* section implements `From` for the unreactive
//! type, allowing users to easily create the base unreactive type from the type
//! it wraps (e.g. `RxVecNested<T>` from a `Vec<T>`). This is primarily used in
//! functions like `get_build_state`, where users can create the normal Rust
//! collection, and just add `.into()` to integrate it with the Perseus
//! state platform. Note that we **do not** implement `From` for the reactive
//! version, as this will never be of use to users (reactive types should only
//! ever come out of Perseus itself, so they can be registered in the state
//! store, etc.).
//!
//! Finally, the *freezing implementation* section implements `Freeze` for the
//! reactive type, which allows Perseus to turn it into a `String` easily for
//! state freezing. Thawing is handled automatically and internally.
//!
//! *A brief note on `RxResult<T, E>`: the reactive result type does not follow
//! the patterns described above, and it defined in a separate module, because
//! it does not have a non-nested equivalent. This is because such a thing would
//! have no point, as there are no 'fields' in a `Result` (or any other
//! `enum`, for that matter) itself. If a non-nested version is required, one
//! should simply use `std::result::Result`. The same goes for `Option<T>`,
//! although there is presently no defined reactive container for this.*
//!
//! **Note:** as a user, you will still have to use `#[rx(nested)]` over any
//! reactive types you use!
