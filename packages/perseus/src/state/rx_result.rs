/// A wrapper for fallible reactive state.
///
/// This is intended for use with the suspense state feature and nested state.
/// Imagine you have a `struct Song` that you derive `ReactiveState` on, having
/// the `album: Album` field use nested reactivity, since `Album` has multiple
/// fields itself. However, for some reason, you'd like to make the `album`
/// field use `#[rx(suspense = "your_handler_fn")]`. If `your_handler_fn()`
/// could lead to an error, then you have to be able to use the pattern
/// `song.album.get()?.name.get()`, rather than just `song.album.name.get()`.
/// The extra `.get()?` is needed since the `Album` is what is suspended state,
/// and it could be an error of some sort. What you need is a reactive `Result`,
/// and this is that. Any type can be placed in this that implements `MakeRx`,
/// `Serialize`, and `Deserialize`. No restrictions are placed on the error
/// type.
///
/// Note that this is intended for use with fallible, nested, suspended state,
/// although it could be easily used in any case where you want to use reactive
/// state that could be an error, conveniently enabling the pattern explained
/// above.
///
/// If you want non-nested, fallible, suspended state, you can simply use
/// `Result<T, E>` from the standard library.
