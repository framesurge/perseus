## Features

- `translator-fluent` --- enables internationalization using [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org)
- `macros` (default) --- adds support for macros that will make your life much easier
- `dflt_engine` (default) --- adds support for the default engine-side mechanics (you would only not want this in extremely niche use-cases)
- `client_helpers` (default) --- adds useful helpers for managing the browser-side
- `hydrate` --- enables Sycamore's *experimental* hydration system (if you experience odd issues, try disabling this)
- `preload-wasm-on-redirect` --- *experimentally* preloads the Wasm bundle for locale redirections (this only partially works right now)
- `idb-freezing` --- enables utilities for freezing your app's state to IndexedDB in the browser (see the book)
- `live-reload` (default) --- enables reloading the browser automatically when you make changes to your app
- `hsr` (default) --- enables *hot state reloading*, which reloads the state of your app right before you made code changes in development, allowing you to pick up where you left off

## Packages

This is the API documentation for the core `perseus` package, which underlies all Perseus apps. Note that Perseus mostly uses [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US) for
documentation, and this should mostly be used as a secondary reference source. You can also find full usage examples [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples).
