# Feature Discovery Terminal

The rest of these docs are written in a bit of an experimental way. Perseus is *really big*, and there are a lot of features that you can use. This is a place where you can learn about them all, and easily find code examples for a particular pattern you want to use. Perseus is written with a ton of a examples, and these are all great sources of information, but they're a bit hard to find sometimes. This page is a list of usage patterns of Perseus that you can use to find exactly what you're looking for!

*Note: this is a bit of an experimental documentation design. Let us know what you think and add your suggestions [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/discussions/new)!*

If you've got a usage pattern that isn't in here, [let us know](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new), and we'll happily add it!
