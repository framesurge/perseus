# Welcome to Perseus!

[Home][repo] • [Crate Page][crate] • [API Documentation][docs] • [Contributing][contrib]

**WARNING:** These docs are under heavy construction right now, in preparation for the release of Perseus v0.4.0, which will be, by far, the most powerful version of Perseus yet! A lot has changed though, so we *highly* recommend sticking to the v0.3.4+ docs if you're using v0.3.x, or the v0.4.x docs if you're still on one of the beta versions up to beta 11. The `next` docs (these ones) are highly incomplete, probably full of errors and typos, and have not yet been thoroughly checked. You have been warned!

Welcome to the Perseus documentation! Here, you'll find guides on how to use Perseus, as well as documentation for specific features and plenty of examples! Note that every code snippet in these docs comes from something in the [examples](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples), where you can get context from real-world code.

If you like Perseus, please consider giving us a star [on GitHub](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus)!
