# Publishing Plugins

After you've written a plugin, you can either use it locally, or you can publish it to the world on <https://crates.io>, Rust's package registry. That will mean anyone in the world can use it in their own code, and you'll be contributing to the Perseus community! It's usual to name plugins beginning with `perseus-` (e.g. `perseus-size-opt`), but this isn't required.

Perseus also maintains a registry of all plugins that have been published, but we rely on users to let us know about their plugins. You can do this by [opening an issue](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/issues/new/choose) on the Perseus repository, and we'll be happy to include your project!

## Trusted Plugins

You may have noticed that some plugins in the Perseus registry have ticks next to them. These plugins are _trusted_, meaning they've been reviewed by the Perseus team and are considered to be high quality and safe to use. Note however that this is in no way a guarantee of quality, and that a trusted plugin may still contain malware or bugs, and that the Perseus team is in no way responsible for any plugin on the registry.

If you'd like to apply for your plugin to be trusted after it's been listed on the registry, reach out to the Perseus maintainer [by email](mailto:arctic_hen7@pm.me), and a code review will be happily undertaken.

By the same token though, an untrusted plugin is not in any way an indication that a plugin is low quality or malicious, it just means it hasn't been reviewed by the Perseus team. If you don't want to have your plugin reviewed, no problem!
