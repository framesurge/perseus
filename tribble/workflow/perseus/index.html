Please make your changes in a pull request and then submit it to us (if you're unfamiliar with this process, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/contributing.md#)). If you need any help, feel free to ask on our [Discord channel on the Sycamore server](https://discord.com/invite/GNqWYWNTdp). Also, [this](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs/advanced/arch) section in the documentation may come in handy.","Add I18n Backend":"Perseus currently uses [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) for internationalization, but it can be extended to support alternatives. If you'd like to add another i18n backend to Perseus, you'll need to add a new file to \`packages/perseus/src/translator\` based on the \`fluent.rs\` file in that directory. Perseus doesn't use a trait to support i18n backends because of the potentially different arguments that each translator can take. This means you'll have to manually ensure that you implement all the required methods, as well as the \`t!\` and \`link!\` macros. A selection of errors is available for you to use, which you can add it to if absolutely necessary.<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Add New Pages to Book":"Adding new pages to the book involves creating them in the appropriate version folder in \`docs/\` (please add your new pages to every relevant version) and then registering your new pages in that version's \`SUMMARY.md\` file. This is a file that's rendered from Markdown as the sidebar on the website, and you should add your pages as list entries to it (nesting is fully possible here). Notably, each list item must be a link, with its name in square brackets and the link text being \`/docs/<path-to-your-file-in-the-filesystem>\`. No \`.md\` file extension should be included. If you're unsure if what you've done has worked, or you just want to see your work, you can preview your changes after running \`bonnie setup\` (which will ask you to install some prerequisites) by running \`bonnie site\`. This runs three commands in parallel, and building the website for the first time will take some time. When it's ready, you'll be able to load <http://localhost:8080> in your browser to preview how your changes will look on the website. After your PR is merged, they'll be automatically applied to the global version of the website. Please also note that you can link to other pages in the docs by using \`:<file-path>\` (no file extension) as the Markdown link target, which avoids having to specify the version and locale.<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Request Enhancement":{"preamble":"Thanks for the idea, we'll take a look! Please press the button below to report the following issue to us. If anything looks incorrect, you can go back and change it now (but please don't edit the final issue body, it's auto-generated).","text":"This issue is requesting an enhancement to Perseus.

Then, alter its contents to reflect the comparison's features (you can see the details of what each field means on [the comparisons page](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/comparisons)). To obtain Lighthouse scores for the comparison, please use <https://pagespeed-insights.com> and point it at a website built with the framework (preferably their own website, but this may not be possible if they're using a third-party documentation provider). Please note that these scores will be double-checked in your PR, and, if there's a major discrepancy between the scores you provide and the scores the reviewer gets, you may be asked to provide screenshots.<br/>Editing an existing comparison should be a very similar process, though please explain in your PR exactly why you're editing it (e.g. a new version has been released that changes its Lighthouse scores or adds new features).<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Repo Docs":"The documentation in the repository is stored as a collection of simple Markdown files. You can make changes to these files without having to worry about any build processes, and then you can open a pull request when you're done. Please make sure you've used consistent formatting and correct grammar before submitting, but if you're unsure of anything, just mention it in your PR, and we'll be happy to help you out in review (especially if English isn't your first language)!<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Add Server Integration":"Perseus currently supports using Actix Web and Warp as server backends, though, long-term, we'd like to support as many different servers as possible! Implementing a new integration can be difficult, but most of the utilities you'll need can be found in \`packages/perseus/server/\`. It's best to use \`packages/perseus-actix-web/\` as a guide, and note that your integration will be a new Rust package. The best way to build an integration is to look through the code of the existing ones, but if you need any help, feel free to ask on [our Discord channel on the Sycamore server](https://discord.com/invite/GNqWYWNTdp)!","Report Docs Issue":{"preamble":"Thanks for reporting your issue! Please press the button below to report the following issue to us. If anything looks incorrect, you can go back and change it now (but please don't edit the final issue body, it's auto-generated).","text":"This issue is reporting a bug in the documentation.\\n- Documentation version: \${docs_version}\\n- Documentation source: \${docs_source}\\nThe user described the issue as follows:\\n> \${docs_issue_desc} ","dest_text":"Report on GitHub","dest_url":"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/new?body=%s"},"Change Existing Content in Book":"If you want to edit the book in some way that doesn't involve adding new pages, you can do this easily by just editing the Markdown files in the \`docs/\` folder. There's a subfolder in there for each major version of Perseus, so please make sure you change the documentation in all relevant versions. Please note that you can link to other pages in the docs by using \`:<file-path>\` (no file extension) as the Markdown link target, which avoids having to specify the version and locale. You can preview your changes after running \`bonnie setup\` (which will ask you to install some prerequisites) by running \`bonnie site\`.

This will be a big job, but it should be as convenient as possible. The documentation on the website can be translated by writing new Markdown files under \`docs/<version>/<locale>\` (currently there's just \`en-US\`). Unlike the rest of the website, the documentation can be translated in parts, as long as you note that it's a work in progress. Please note though that you'll need to create at least a partial translation for *every* version of Perseus. That said, there's not a lot of point in translating the v0.1.x documentation, since it's so obsolete, so you might just have an introduction page there in the new language that states that the version isn't supported in this language. If you perform a partial translation for a version (as in translating multiple pages), please create a page for every page in the source language (\`en-US\`), and just note on the pages you haven't done yet that they're untranslated for now (do not omit pages fully, this can cause problems).<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Translate Website":"First off, thank you so much for offering to translate the website, it's one of the best ways to help Perseus grow! The Perseus website is already fully enabled for i18n, and all you need to do to translate it is add new \`<locale>.ftl\` files under \`website/translations/\`. Currently, there's just an \`en-US.ftl\` file there, which contains all the translation IDs needed. If you wanted to translate the website into, say, Russian, you'd create duplicate that file and rename the copy to \`ru-RU.ftl\`, and then you'd translate each of the IDs inside.<br/>When you're done, please add the new locale to \`website/src/lib.rs\` (only if the documentation has also been translated into this language though).<br/>If you're unfamiliar with the process of forking and making pull requests, please see [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#).","Submit Plugin":{"preamble":"Thanks for submitting your plugin!
